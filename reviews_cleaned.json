All of this is simulated so the perception of and danger is real, e.g. you can get hacked if you don't build up your defense while being on the offense to set up your own tools. The other dimensions of building your own enemies & allies (multiplayer), the concept becomes an automatic Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) since not everyone is not the same (evil or good).\n\nIn conclusion, it's amazing how much has been developed in terms of toolsets and script lanaguage (meaning the toolset can be infinitely be improved by the community).","voted_up":1,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":21,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":21,"author_playtime_at_review":17,"author_last_played":1703529507000,"textblob_sentiment":0.2594298246,"log_playtime_forever":3.0910424534,"log_playtime_at_review":2.8903717579,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":3.0910424534,"normalized_playtime_forever":-2.44891615,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-2.2881528424,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.8941082239,"playtime_ratio":0.8095238095,"days_from_last_played_time":22,"review_length":892,"review_word_count":157,"engagement_score":3,"playtime_category":"Low","reviewer_experience":"Experienced","vader_sentiment":0.7269,"cleaned_review_tokens":["a","good","and","i","mean","good","hacking","simulator","for","both","understanding","and","illustrating","the","danger","of","vulnerabilities","a","good","guide","to","understand","and","find","out","how","to","play","and","a","good","realistic","toolset","in","a","real","system","now","imagine","a","real","setting","where","you","have","a","computer","sniffing","and","trying","to","get","access","to","a","wifi","network","so","you","have","access","to","the","internet","all","of","this","is","simulated","so","the","perception","of","and","danger","is","real","eg","you","can","get","hacked","if","you","dont","build","up","your","defense","while","being","on","the","offense","to","set","up","your","own","tools","the","other","dimensions","of","building","your","own","enemies","allies","multiplayer","the","concept","becomes","an","automatic","massive","multiplayer","online","mmo","since","not","everyone","is","not","the","same","evil","or","good","in","conclusion","its","amazing","how","much","has","been","developed","in","terms","of","toolsets","and","script","lanaguage","meaning","the","toolset","can","be","infinitely","be","improved","by","the","community"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["good","mean","good","hacking","simulator","understanding","illustrating","danger","vulnerabilities","good","guide","understand","find","play","good","realistic","toolset","real","system","imagine","real","setting","computer","sniffing","trying","get","access","wifi","network","access","internet","simulated","perception","danger","real","eg","get","hacked","dont","build","defense","offense","set","tools","dimensions","building","enemies","allies","multiplayer","concept","becomes","automatic","massive","multiplayer","online","mmo","since","everyone","evil","good","conclusion","amazing","much","developed","terms","toolsets","script","lanaguage","meaning","toolset","infinitely","improved","community"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"good mean good hacking simulator understanding illustrating danger vulnerabilities good guide understand find play good realistic toolset real system imagine real setting computer sniffing trying get access wifi network access internet simulated perception danger real eg get hacked dont build defense offense set tools dimensions building enemies allies multiplayer concept becomes automatic massive multiplayer online mmo since everyone evil good conclusion amazing much developed terms toolsets script lanaguage meaning toolset infinitely improved community","retention_score":0.214457348,"retention_score_scaled":0.449334765}

{"review":"I already have quite some experience with the game and my play-style is all about coding. Just a few examples of what I achieved so far:\n- Created a script that identifies the best WiFi network, hacks it and connects me to it\n- Created a utility script that stores found vulnerabilities in a txt file and restores it as a map. This allows me to avoid rescanning already scanned libraries\n\nNow I am working on an automated attack script that scans an IP, identifies vulnerabilities and exploits them automatically. The real life script that I want to mimic is called armitage. It tries to run exploits automatically until the user gets access. \n\nI only finished the first mission so far in this run, just to validate if my coding works as I want to.\n\nFuture extensions would be:\n- Acquire all relevant libraries using the repo manager automatically\n- Remote code execution: All attack scripts are developed on my localhost, but the execution is always locally on a remote machine. \n- Automated log trace clean up \n- Hardening of my local system in order to make it as secure as possible\n\nI really recommend this game as it can be played as kind of a puzzle game, while teaching you about logic, basic programming and security topics in general. Most mechanics have real live equivalents.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.683593094348907471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":8531,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":8531,"author_last_played":1698533085000,"textblob_sentiment":0.1065850816,"log_playtime_forever":9.0515790796,"log_playtime_at_review":9.0515790796,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.9683587883,"normalized_playtime_at_review":1.5916853906,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":1.0,"days_from_last_played_time":80,"review_length":1286,"review_word_count":226,"engagement_score":16,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9466,"cleaned_review_tokens":["i","already","have","quite","some","experience","with","the","game","and","my","playstyle","is","all","about","coding","just","a","few","examples","of","what","i","achieved","so","far","created","a","script","that","identifies","the","best","wifi","network","hacks","it","and","connects","me","to","it","created","a","utility","script","that","stores","found","vulnerabilities","in","a","txt","file","and","restores","it","as","a","map","this","allows","me","to","avoid","rescanning","already","scanned","libraries","now","i","am","working","on","an","automated","attack","script","that","scans","an","ip","identifies","vulnerabilities","and","exploits","them","automatically","the","real","life","script","that","i","want","to","mimic","is","called","armitage","it","tries","to","run","exploits","automatically","until","the","user","gets","access","i","only","finished","the","first","mission","so","far","in","this","run","just","to","validate","if","my","coding","works","as","i","want","to","future","extensions","would","be","acquire","all","relevant","libraries","using","the","repo","manager","automatically","remote","code","execution","all","attack","scripts","are","developed","on","my","localhost","but","the","execution","is","always","locally","on","a","remote","machine","automated","log","trace","clean","up","hardening","of","my","local","system","in","order","to","make","it","as","secure","as","possible","i","really","recommend","this","game","as","it","can","be","played","as","kind","of","a","puzzle","game","while","teaching","you","about","logic","basic","programming","and","security","topics","in","general","most","mechanics","have","real","live","equivalents"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["already","quite","experience","playstyle","coding","examples","achieved","far","created","script","identifies","best","wifi","network","hacks","connects","created","utility","script","stores","found","vulnerabilities","txt","file","restores","map","allows","avoid","rescanning","already","scanned","libraries","working","automated","attack","script","scans","ip","identifies","vulnerabilities","exploits","automatically","real","life","script","want","mimic","called","armitage","tries","run","exploits","automatically","user","gets","access","finished","first","mission","far","run","validate","coding","works","want","future","extensions","would","acquire","relevant","libraries","using","repo","manager","automatically","remote","code","execution","attack","scripts","developed","localhost","execution","always","locally","remote","machine","automated","log","trace","clean","hardening","local","system","order","make","secure","possible","really","recommend","played","kind","puzzle","teaching","logic","basic","programming","security","topics","general","mechanics","real","live","equivalents"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"already quite experience playstyle coding examples achieved far created script identifies best wifi network hacks connects created utility script stores found vulnerabilities txt file restores map allows avoid rescanning already scanned libraries working automated attack script scans ip identifies vulnerabilities exploits automatically real life script want mimic called armitage tries run exploits automatically user gets access finished first mission far run validate coding works want future extensions would acquire relevant libraries using repo manager automatically remote code execution attack scripts developed localhost execution always locally remote machine automated log trace clean hardening local system order make secure possible really recommend played kind puzzle teaching logic basic programming security topics general mechanics real live equivalents","retention_score":0.3801723716,"retention_score_scaled":0.5655393603}

{"review":"Almost 100 hours in now and I can say the game is pretty fun. However, the community, not so much. I suggest just playing SP at least for now. There isn't much to do online that is a whole lot different than single player except add a risk that another player ruins your save or that you can ruin another players save. If that is an element you're looking for, go for it. I also suggest avoiding the Discord, quickly found myself blocking elitist ass hats and trolls. I mean I get it, that is sort of what the internet is, but I think this game's theme and design brings out some of the worst.\n\nOverall great game and loads of fun for anyone who is into the Linux OS feel and terminal design or loves programming.

{"review":"Highly recommended.  I've already got three days enjoyment out of it.\n\nIt's probably nowhere near as involved as real hacking, but it is still the most highly realistic hacking game I've seen.  It seems to have a storyline \/ in-game lore that you pick up as you go about missions.  The game draws you in quite well and explains things slowly.  You don't have to code if you don't want and the commands are introduced at a leisurely pace.  Eventually you'll find yourself curious and start digging into the scripts behind the exploits you buy from the black market website.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm still playing the single player.  There is a multi-player, but I'm guessing it's much more \"dangerous\" and fast-paced given that you are up against real people.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.492015540599822998","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":20606,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":1350,"author_last_played":1681613661000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.0194642857,"log_playtime_forever":9.9333861029,"log_playtime_at_review":7.208600338,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":1.4739134439,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.4311239923,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.0655148986,"days_from_last_played_time":276,"review_length":759,"review_word_count":131,"engagement_score":3,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Veteran","vader_sentiment":0.8403,"cleaned_review_tokens":["highly","recommended","ive","already","got","three","days","enjoyment","out","of","it","its","probably","nowhere","near","as","involved","as","real","hacking","but","it","is","still","the","most","highly","realistic","hacking","game","ive","seen","it","seems","to","have","a","storyline","ingame","lore","that","you","pick","up","as","you","go","about","missions","the","game","draws","you","in","quite","well","and","explains","things","slowly","you","dont","have","to","code","if","you","dont","want","and","the","commands","are","introduced","at","a","leisurely","pace","eventually","youll","find","yourself","curious","and","start","digging","into","the","scripts","behind","the","exploits","you","buy","from","the","black","market","website","for","what","its","worth","im","still","playing","the","single","player","there","is","a","multiplayer","but","im","guessing","its","much","more","dangerous","and","fastpaced","given","that","you","are","up","against","real","people"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["highly","recommended","ive","already","got","three","days","enjoyment","probably","nowhere","near","involved","real","hacking","still","highly","realistic","hacking","ive","seen","seems","storyline","ingame","lore","pick","go","missions","draws","quite","well","explains","things","slowly","dont","code","dont","want","commands","introduced","leisurely","pace","eventually","youll","find","curious","start","digging","scripts","behind","exploits","buy","black","market","website","worth","im","still","playing","single","player","multiplayer","im","guessing","much","dangerous","fastpaced","given","real","people"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"highly recommended ive already got three days enjoyment probably nowhere near involved real hacking still highly realistic hacking ive seen seems storyline ingame lore pick go missions draws quite well explains things slowly dont code dont want commands introduced leisurely pace eventually youll find curious start digging scripts behind exploits buy black market website worth im still playing single player multiplayer im guessing much dangerous fastpaced given real people","retention_score":0.3909389821,"retention_score_scaled":0.5730892468}

The community is relatively nice and will be sure to help you if you need anything, the gameplay is very simplified from real hacking but is still quite enjoyable, and if you're not too into the hacking aspect you can still create services for other players to use.

{"review":"If you're looking for a very in-depth hacking simulator, this is the most interesting that I've played. The game encourages you to learn about coding and writing your own custom programs to execute commands and uses a very realistic language and file structure.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling thing here is the idea of a living MMO environment. I highly recommend using this option, rather than the solo. The community that I've encountered have all been very friendly and helpful in pointing me toward resources to learn my way around the shared hacking world.\n\nThe dev updates the game pretty constantly, from what I've seen so far. I always advise checking the Community section to make sure development of Early Access hasn't stalled out. \n\nIf you enjoy Hacknet or Hacking Simulator, this is going to be more technical and open world. You basically just get pointed toward resources and told to take the jobs that you want. I haven't delved into the hardware aspect, but it looks like you have a lot of interesting choices to be making there as you make some money and build a rep in the game world.\n\nIt's a very specific niche, but I highly recommend it if this sort of game would appeal to you in the slightest.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505882382392883301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":826,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":447,"author_last_played":1700047686000,"textblob_sentiment":0.1749666667,"log_playtime_forever":6.717804695,"log_playtime_at_review":6.1047932324,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-0.3696329423,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-0.2639659123,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.5411622276,"days_from_last_played_time":63,"review_length":1215,"review_word_count":213,"engagement_score":2,"playtime_category":"High","reviewer_experience":"Veteran","vader_sentiment":0.9784,"cleaned_review_tokens":["if","youre","looking","for","a","very","indepth","hacking","simulator","this","is","the","most","interesting","that","ive","played","the","game","encourages","you","to","learn","about","coding","and","writing","your","own","custom","programs","to","execute","commands","and","uses","a","very","realistic","language","and","file","structure","perhaps","the","most","compelling","thing","here","is","the","idea","of","a","living","mmo","environment","i","highly","recommend","using","this","option","rather","than","the","solo","the","community","that","ive","encountered","have","all","been","very","friendly","and","helpful","in","pointing","me","toward","resources","to","learn","my","way","around","the","shared","hacking","world","the","dev","updates","the","game","pretty","constantly","from","what","ive","seen","so","far","i","always","advise","checking","the","community","section","to","make","sure","development","of","early","access","hasnt","stalled","out","if","you","enjoy","hacknet","or","hacking","simulator","this","is","going","to","be","more","technical","and","open","world","you","basically","just","get","pointed","toward","resources","and","told","to","take","the","jobs","that","you","want","i","havent","delved","into","the","hardware","aspect","but","it","looks","like","you","have","a","lot","of","interesting","choices","to","be","making","there","as","you","make","some","money","and","build","a","rep","in","the","game","world","its","a","very","specific","niche","but","i","highly","recommend","it","if","this","sort","of","game","would","appeal","to","you","in","the","slightest"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["youre","looking","indepth","hacking","simulator","interesting","ive","played","encourages","learn","coding","writing","custom","programs","execute","commands","uses","realistic","language","file","structure","perhaps","compelling","thing","idea","living","mmo","environment","highly","recommend","using","option","rather","solo","community","ive","encountered","friendly","helpful","pointing","toward","resources","learn","way","around","shared","hacking","world","dev","updates","pretty","constantly","ive","seen","far","always","advise","checking","community","section","make","sure","development","early","access","hasnt","stalled","enjoy","hacknet","hacking","simulator","going","technical","open","world","basically","get","pointed","toward","resources","told","take","jobs","want","havent","delved","hardware","aspect","looks","like","lot","interesting","choices","making","make","money","build","rep","world","specific","niche","highly","recommend","sort","would","appeal","slightest"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"youre looking indepth hacking simulator interesting ive played encourages learn coding writing custom programs execute commands uses realistic language file structure perhaps compelling thing idea living mmo environment highly recommend using option rather solo community ive encountered friendly helpful pointing toward resources learn way around shared hacking world dev updates pretty constantly ive seen far always advise checking community section make sure development early access hasnt stalled enjoy hacknet hacking simulator going technical open world basically get pointed toward resources told take jobs want havent delved hardware aspect looks like lot interesting choices making make money build rep world specific niche highly recommend sort would appeal slightest","retention_score":0.2784084644,"retention_score_scaled":0.4941793026}

{"review":"13 hours in and I still have no fucking idea what I'm doing\n\nIn fairness:\nThis is not a game for the wannabe hacker. The coding system is very *POORLY* explained, going as far as not to even tell you what it's based on and it's a coding language I'm completely unfamiliar with. Feels like Javascript, isn't Javascript.\n100% I feel like there's networks I just can't hack into without coding something up myself. But I can't figure out how to make an exploit if I can't figure out how to even get the interpreter to stop throwing me a NULL every time I try to use scan_address. Going to the hacker store and just buying exploits feels like I'm taking a chance, another $65-150 out of my (virtual) bank to even have a chance to do remotely what I want to do. And searching through the store picking out exploits that just might have a chance of working is grinding, grueling.\n\nBut it feels so goddamn great when the exploit you throw actually works.\n\nThere's bugs in this game, I believe. I was probing a network and I believe I had everything together for a Admin Online to use a Root User exploit, and it just wouldn't work. Got the admin to acknowledge me and when I threw the exploit it failed.\nIt's a great puzzle game, I'm not going to lie, but it's like playing 4d chess when you really just want to play 3d chess\n\nTLDR:\nThis game is really good for those with coding experience. If you don't, and decide to pick it up anyway, prepare for a lot of pain.

{"review":"I'm enjoying the game, I love the game but if you're looking for a fun time? I'd recommend other games that are on the easier side like Uplink or HackNet. Honestly, I wish there was a \"Maybe\" option instead of Yes or No.\n\nBut let's start with the positives.\n\nI've been playing for about 40 hours according to my stats. I spent the first 20-30 hours trying to solve one of the missions after the tutorial (which I needed a video to figure out). When I couldn't do it myself, I went to the Offical Discord server and started asking for help. I got help in figuring out the steps for breaking into the system and even learned how to do one of the tricks where you use a combination of Social Engineering and the in-game Rshell. It's great, it's amazing. I've never seen Social Engineering as a method for Hacking in a game before. \n\nI've managed to complete all 6 of the Hack Shop missions at one point (Get Credentials (Specific and Any), Police Records and Academic Changes, Corrupt Data, and Get Remote File. When I first started, I was sure I was going to be stuck in \"Get Credentials\" for the rest of my playthrough but I'm glad I was wrong. \n\nI also realized that the best way to make money in the game is by stealing from Bank Accounts which are a lot easier than I thought, you won't always get much. The most I've taken is about 2-3k? But if you hoard bank accounts you might be able to get some passive income by visiting those accounts semi-regularly since they apparently replenish every ingame month?\n\nHere's a fun fact, it's actually realistic how easy it is to get money from a bank account. Maybe not the getting away with it part but yeah, Banks don't usually disclose the fact that your account lost 200-300 bucks.\n\nCovering your tracks in this game is more or less simple and easy enough too, the NPC's in the game aren't all that fast or effective and if you're like me who is compulsively collecting rental servers around the world, you'll have more freedom to do what you need to do without getting caught. So far, I've been deleting my tracks and haven't been caught by an NPC so that's something... But the ones that I'm worried about the most are the other players.\n\nHere are the downsides of the game.\n\nIt's an MMO, if the Dev ever gets tired, runs out of money (for server maintenance, though not sure if this game takes up that much space, who knows), disappears. There's a good chance you can never play this game again. There's a single-player but I haven't tried it and I'm going to guess that it won't feel like you're playing the actual game the way it was meant to be played.\n\nThere's a PVP aspect and while I've been lucky enough that nobody has actually hacked me (as far as I know), that will be looming over your head and I don't really see any protections from that beyond actually preventing people from entering your system...\n\nI'm not a professional programmer or coder. The only way I'm learning is by trial and error, the Hackers Handbook, and by bothering people on the Discord to tell me what I'm missing. From what I can see, the only way to protect yourself is to keep your head down and if you know how to input the right console commands. Not sure if deleting your logs will help but hasn't stopped me from doing it.\n\n[url=https:\/\/imgur.com\/sfnTBjf]Protect Yourself Commands[\/url]\n\nThese are the console commands I'm using, does it do anything? No idea... Will it do anything? No idea.\n\nI'm currently Rank 1 in the game, so far the only access I have in terms of Hacking Missions is the Hack Stop and I'm stuck as a Black Hat hacker until I have enough experience to unlock the Police Station jobs. I would have liked it better if both jobs were available right at the start so you can actually be a Grey Hat Hacker but it's fine, I'll make up for my badness by not completely draining every bank account I 'visit.'\n\nThe reason why I said my rank is because I'm noticing a trend, after the tutorial... The game has a noticeable difficulty spike. By that I mean the Exploits System, it's a great system but it's not perfect if you have a mission where you have multiple available ports? Amazing. BUT if you're like me and you end up trying to access computers with only one port (It happens where the mission specifies a port NOT in the initial list of the Nmap Scan or if you're trying to find bank accounts), the Exploit system starts falling apart. You NEED one or two specific Exploit when you're dealing with a system that isn't ftp or ssh. It's the remote access one and you'd better hope that the requirements are possible, more often than not my target rarely meets them.\n\nThe other exploit is the one that grabs email addresses but It hasn't worked that much because of the aforementioned requirements.\n\nCurrently, I have two missions that I can't complete. The first one? The only port gives exploits that don't meet any of the requirements. I can't even Rshell into the system. Official Server's Helpdesk recommended router exploits to pull emails also didn't work. The second one? The Target IP doesn't have any open ports. Routers don't have any pull Email Exploits.\n\n[url=https:\/\/imgur.com\/hznunN6]No Ports[\/url]\n\nThe only solution I was told to do? Make your own script\/exploits. That's out of the question, I don't know enough to actually do that and I don't enjoy the fact that the game is making me do that. The only player-made script store is the BTC Store. There's an actual cryptocurrency store in the game. Honestly, I'm not a fan of Cryptocurrencies in the Real World (so much electricity used up to mine even a single cryptocurrency) but I was desperate enough that I decided to check out the BTC Store, the price of the best tools (the only tools, as far as I know, that can solve my problem) is 60, and 20 BTC and that's assuming the Script creators didn't put any malicious stuff in the code because the BTC Store actually warn you against that. BTC Mining is going to take a very long time and if more people started playing this game? You'll likely spend hours just mining for one measly coin. Of course, you could use the BTC Boost but it's going to brick your in-game computer and if you can't afford to replace it (or worse the only replacement doesn't fit your motherboard? You're out of luck)\n\nThis game is realistic, it's fun if you love the concept of breaking into systems after trying to figure it out. But you're going to need to learn how to script if you want to keep completing missions because so far? My only choice is just to ignore\/delete missions that I can't complete. The fact that Player-Made Scripts are sold using a hard-to-earn\/get currency gives a vague Pay to Win vibe. Maybe if there was a way to convert your in-game cash into BTC it would be easier to swallow.\n\nBut you know what? I'm still going to play this damn game. I spent actual money on it and I do plan on getting an ICT degree in the real world and this game kinda helped convince me that It won't be completely useless and I wouldn't hate it. But this game isn't going to always be fun for me. This game is going to favor the professionals who already have a headstart by virtue of knowing what to do. Think of it like Ready Player One, it's an Open World Game where someone created a ridiculously powerful robot. A game where one player nuked everyone but the only one who survived was the one who had what I'm 90% sure is a developer-made coin that revived him. \n\nGrey Hack is an amazing game made by one person (I believe) with an open world that feels genuinely alive and gives you the freedom to do as you please. But there isn't any enforcement in the game (for the hacking or any other activities performed by the players) outside of the in-game cops and maybe even other hackers. You have the 'freedom' to create scripts and you're not going to have a good time if you don't know how or if you aren't interested in scripting because it's going to feel like you're missing out on a big part of the game (You likely are).","voted_up":1,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.760444939136505127","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":5950,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":2884,"author_last_played":1685559815000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0369063492,"log_playtime_forever":8.6913145516,"log_playtime_at_review":7.9672801789,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.7618131332,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.9088802015,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.4847058824,"days_from_last_played_time":230,"review_length":7993,"review_word_count":1460,"engagement_score":31,"playtime_category":"Very

{"review":"I've got nearly 40 hours in the game currently and still have no idea what I'm doing - 10\/10\n\nIf you're considering this game then you need to understand that it doesn't hold your hand too much. The tutorial shows you a brief walk through of some unix terminal commands before telling you \"Go read the manual and work out how to hack a wifi network so you can go online\". Most of the rest of the game is like that where you experiment with commands and attack ideas to see what works. If you're the type of person that enjoys programming and solving puzzles then you'll enjoy this. If you're just looking for something that makes you feel like a 1337 h4X0r by clicking a few GUI buttons then I'd skip it and go look at Uplink or HackNet.\n\nThe game has 2 modes, online and single player. The main focus is online and working to secure your own systems as much as exploit others. Most of the terminal commands have the associated scripting in the manual and you're encouraged to write your own scripts and create binaries to speed up hacking. There's 4 main mission types available relating to hacking NPC networks which grow in difficulty and are randomised each time you select a new job. Players can create their own websites in game for selling their code creations or posting bounties on systems and of course these get hacked and defaced from time to time as other players see them as challenges in their own right.\n\nIt's still very much early access but if you check the news section and have a look at the discussion forum you'll see the developer is constantly updating and taking on player feedback. There's some big goals in mind for the game but even at this point I find it really fun to play.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":38,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.811902165412902832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":6605,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":2336,"author_last_played":1693351253000,"textblob_sentiment":0.1115800866,"log_playtime_forever":8.795733606,"log_playtime_at_review":7.7566233345,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.8216783164,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.7762252791,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.353671461,"days_from_last_played_time":140,"review_length":1704,"review_word_count":313,"engagement_score":40,"playtime_category":"Very

{"review":"I\u2019m excited to see how this game evolves. I may or may not have done a bit of grey-hat in my time. I can say that this game is the closest you can get to a legal black-hat hacking simulator apart from OTW:Wargames. The multiplayer \u201cinternet\u201d is also hilariously accurate with the website defacements. \n\nThe process is still very simplified when it comes to exploitation: it basically boils down to passing in some magic keys during a connection. Not realistic, but much less monotonous than real vulnerability discovery. \n\nThere is still a lot of jank. The universal programming language, GreyScript, is a bit fiddly. It\u2019s based on Lua, but doesn\u2019t have an interactive mode, which makes learning the nuances of the language a bit tough. Some of the missions made no sense at all: such as someone requesting for me to change their records on a computer that THEY themselves own. Networking things can also be strange, such as two different subnets connecting through a single switch (no Vlans).

{"review":"When it comes down to most games that happen to be made about the world of hacking they're usually very flashy at best, Really shallow or flat out wrong at worst. But grey Hack offers something that most really don't and that's a real attempt at a realistic hacking simulator. Unlike most this game doesn't really do flashy, But rather get's to the point about the look and feel of the world of hacking. But i think the real charm is in the MMO part of the game. So if you happen to play just the single player of the game don't let that fool you as to the amount the game has to offer you. Given its not really a single player game it doesn't offer too much there. The real meat is the multiplayer game, Here you'll see a much bigger world with people just like you hacking into anything they can get their terminals into. As well as people making their own sites, Shops, Exploits and scripts. Some making full on hacking tools. All of this you can make too should you take the time to learn how. \n\nI guess the biggest question as to whenever this game is worth putting time into depends entirely on your tolerance of how much your willing to learn and fail a few time to keep playing. For now anyway i highly recommend playing this game if you have the will and time.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":2273,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":2238,"author_last_played":1652160769000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.039049654,"log_playtime_forever":7.7292956743,"log_playtime_at_review":7.7137846166,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.2102716855,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.7492488625,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.9846018478,"days_from_last_played_time":617,"review_length":1269,"review_word_count":242,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9576,"cleaned_review_tokens":["when","it","comes","down","to","most","games","that","happen","to","be","made","about","the","world","of","hacking","theyre","usually","very","flashy","at","best","really","shallow","or","flat","out","wrong","at","worst","but","grey","hack","offers","something","that","most","really","dont","and","thats","a","real","attempt","at","a","realistic","hacking","simulator","unlike","most","this","game","doesnt","really","do","flashy","but","rather","gets","to","the","point","about","the","look","and","feel","of","the","world","of","hacking","but","i","think","the","real","charm","is","in","the","mmo","part","of","the","game","so","if","you","happen","to","play","just","the","single","player","of","the","game","dont","let","that","fool","you","as","to","the","amount","the","game","has","to","offer","you","given","its","not","really","a","single","player","game","it","doesnt","offer","too","much","there","the","real","meat","is","the","multiplayer","game","here","youll","see","a","much","bigger","world","with","people","just","like","you","hacking","into","anything","they","can","get","their","terminals","into","as","well","as","people","making","their","own","sites","shops","exploits","and","scripts","some","making","full","on","hacking","tools","all","of","this","you","can","make","too","should","you","take","the","time","to","learn","how","i","guess","the","biggest","question","as","to","whenever","this","game","is","worth","putting","time","into","depends","entirely","on","your","tolerance","of","how","much","your","willing","to","learn","and","fail","a","few","time","to","keep","playing","for","now","anyway","i","highly","recommend","playing","this","game","if","you","have","the","will","and","time"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["comes","games","happen","made","world","hacking","theyre","usually","flashy","best","really","shallow","flat","wrong","worst","grey","hack","offers","something","really","dont","thats","real","attempt","realistic","hacking","simulator","unlike","doesnt","really","flashy","rather","gets","point","look","feel","world","hacking","think","real","charm","mmo","part","happen","play","single","player","dont","let","fool","amount","offer","given","really","single","player","doesnt","offer","much","real","meat","multiplayer","youll","see","much","bigger","world","people","like","hacking","anything","get","terminals","well","people","making","sites","shops","exploits","scripts","making","full","hacking","tools","make","take","time","learn","guess","biggest","question","whenever","worth","putting","time","depends","entirely","tolerance","much","willing","learn","fail","time","keep","playing","anyway","highly","recommend","playing","time"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"comes games happen made world hacking theyre usually flashy best really shallow flat wrong worst grey hack offers something really dont thats real attempt realistic hacking simulator unlike doesnt really flashy rather gets point look feel world hacking think real charm mmo part happen play single player dont let fool amount offer given really single player doesnt offer much real meat multiplayer youll see much bigger world people like hacking anything get terminals well people making sites shops exploits scripts making full hacking tools make take time learn guess biggest question whenever worth putting time depends entirely tolerance much willing learn fail time keep playing anyway highly recommend playing time","retention_score":0.2876635334,"retention_score_scaled":0.5006692485}

But not for those without commitment.\nI like, that you can write our own scripts especially. Right now I write, let's say a rootkit or multitool. There are a lot of limitations and some bugs as well, unfortunately, but for an early access game... this is awesome piece of work. \n\nI'm glad this game showed up to me and that I gave it some time to test it. \n\nAlready have high expectations of Loading Home. \nThank you and I will look out for the next updates.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510948896408081055","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":1624,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":1571,"author_last_played":1632239658000,"textblob_sentiment":0.1799285714,"log_playtime_forever":7.3932630948,"log_playtime_at_review":7.360103973,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.01761861,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.5265289292,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.967364532,"days_from_last_played_time":847,"review_length":847,"review_word_count":154,"engagement_score":3,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9301,"cleaned_review_tokens":["really","nice","simulation","of","hacking","i","work","with","it","technologies","daily","do","programming","when","needed","and","can","say","i","enjoy","this","game","very","much","in","my","opinion","this","is","good","for","people","who","either","want","to","learn","something","about","computers","and","networks","although","very","limited","as","of","now","or","for","those","that","actually","have","the","knowledge","if","you","enjoyed","uplink","or","hacknet","then","this","is","the","next","level","but","not","for","those","without","commitment","i","like","that","you","can","write","our","own","scripts","especially","right","now","i","write","lets","say","a","rootkit","or","multitool","there","are","a","lot","of","limitations","and","some","bugs","as","well","unfortunately","but","for","an","early","access","game","this","is","awesome","piece","of","work","im","glad","this","game","showed","up","to","me","and","that","i","gave","it","some","time","to","test","it","already","have","high","expectations","of","loading","home","thank","you","and","i","will","look","out","for","the","next","updates"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["really","nice","simulation","hacking","work","technologies","daily","programming","needed","say","enjoy","much","opinion","good","people","either","want","learn","something","computers","networks","although","limited","actually","knowledge","enjoyed","uplink","hacknet","next","level","without","commitment","like","write","scripts","especially","right","write","lets","say","rootkit","multitool","lot","limitations","bugs","well","unfortunately","early","access","awesome","piece","work","im","glad","showed","gave","time","test","already","high","expectations","loading","home","thank","look","next","updates"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"really nice simulation hacking work technologies daily programming needed say enjoy much opinion good people either want learn something computers networks although limited actually knowledge enjoyed uplink hacknet next level without commitment like write scripts especially right write lets say rootkit multitool lot limitations bugs well unfortunately early access awesome piece work im glad showed gave time test already high expectations loading home thank look next updates","retention_score":0.2682014764,"retention_score_scaled":0.487021841}

{"review":"Time for me to write a review of Grey Hack:\n\nI haven't tried a game this interactive before. What you learn, what you do and how your develop your skills, all have a deep impact on the gameplay and game experience itself.\n\nYou make a mistake, you'll learn of it. You experience success, you'll learn of it. The key to master this game is to be curious and willing to learn new stuff.\n\nAccomplish missions against NPC's (Non-Player Characters\/A.I.) or try to find and hack real players as yourself - but remember: real players are able to find and hack you aswell!\n\nBe patient, think strategic and take the needed time to explore the environments and possibilities - like a real hacker would do. Use the simple in-game scripts and tools or develop your own to make advanced tools. Automation is the way to go.\n\nThe script language is relatively simple and easy to learn, even if you haven't much experience in scripting\/programming. You'll find help and hints in the in-game manual (find it on your home desktop) and by consulting the official docs to Grey script: https:\/\/codedocs.ghtools.xyz\/.\n\nYou'll even find player-generated guides on Steam and player videos on YouTube.\n\nGrey Hack is a fantastic game, if you have a minimum of technical knowledge and\/or interest in scripting\/learning to script. Don't expect this game to be a fast arcade game, you can play quickly on you lunch break. It's not. This game is time consuming, but fun once you start to get the hang of it.\n\nBe patient, be curious and explore the many secrets in this

{"review":"A fun and realistic hacking game with accurate Linux behaviour like having the terminal and correct commands, in the game there is some in game scripting (which is pretty ease) needed to get data (easy to find online) for how you are going to hack and optionally use the script to automate the hacking for you (you can buy scripts with the in game browser). Want to make money? Well, you can also steal bank credential and move the money to your account. Want to hack other Grey Hack players? You can! The online multiplayer part of the game connects you to a main server where if you find a way to get another player's IP address you can get into their computer and take their money or trash their system. There is so much to the game and is pretty fun even if you have no idea what you are doing, and the help you get from the Grey Hack discord server is amazing!","voted_up":1,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":2898,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":1209,"author_last_played":1690683277000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0304824561,"log_playtime_forever":7.9721211289,"log_playtime_at_review":7.0983756386,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.3494875636,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.3617132453,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.417184265,"days_from_last_played_time":171,"review_length":865,"review_word_count":165,"engagement_score":4,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Experienced","vader_sentiment":0.958,"cleaned_review_tokens":["a","fun","and","realistic","hacking","game","with","accurate","linux","behaviour","like","having","the","terminal","and","correct","commands","in","the","game","there","is","some","in","game","scripting","which","is","pretty","ease","needed","to","get","data","easy","to","find","online","for","how","you","are","going","to","hack","and","optionally","use","the","script","to","automate","the","hacking","for","you","you","can","buy","scripts","with","the","in","game","browser","want","to","make","money","well","you","can","also","steal","bank","credential","and","move","the","money","to","your","account","want","to","hack","other","grey","hack","players","you","can","the","online","multiplayer","part","of","the","game","connects","you","to","a","main","server","where","if","you","find","a","way","to","get","another","players","ip","address","you","can","get","into","their","computer","and","take","their","money","or","trash","their","system","there","is","so","much","to","the","game","and","is","pretty","fun","even","if","you","have","no","idea","what","you","are","doing","and","the","help","you","get","from","the","grey","hack","discord","server","is","amazing"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["fun","realistic","hacking","accurate","linux","behaviour","like","terminal","correct","commands","scripting","pretty","ease","needed","get","data","easy","find","online","going","hack","optionally","use","script","automate","hacking","buy","scripts","browser","want","make","money","well","also","steal","bank","credential","move","money","account","want","hack","grey","hack","players","online","multiplayer","part","connects","main","server","find","way","get","another","players","ip","address","get","computer","take","money","trash","system","much","pretty","fun","even","idea","help","get","grey","hack","discord","server","amazing"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"fun realistic hacking accurate linux behaviour like terminal correct commands scripting pretty ease needed get data easy find online going hack optionally use script automate hacking buy scripts browser want make money well also steal bank credential move money account want hack grey hack players online multiplayer part connects main server find way get another players ip address get computer take money trash system much pretty fun even idea help get grey hack discord server amazing","retention_score":0.322774338,"retention_score_scaled":0.5252900509}
{"review":"I would not recommend this game for everyone.\n\nIf you just want a simple \"push button to hack\" the game will be pretty boring. You can buy hacks in the shop and proceed though the storyless game (still  being worked on). I really would not recommend if this is what you want.\n\nIn this game you can make your own scripts and can go so far beyond a normal hacking game. You can automate everything as you would in real life. You can type one command and literally have the entire hacking process automated.\n\nThis is not real life in any way, the hacking is quick and painless, but it follows the general ideas well and it feels legit as you play it.\n\nUplink and this game are my two favs. One the big hollywood style, and this game trying to offer you a sim without needing a diploma.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587426364421844482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":2324,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":1896,"author_last_played":1693777550000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.1008333333,"log_playtime_forever":7.751475318,"log_playtime_at_review":7.5480289699,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.2229876447,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.6448691424,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.8158347676,"days_from_last_played_time":135,"review_length":782,"review_word_count":149,"engagement_score":7,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Veteran","vader_sentiment":0.7176,"cleaned_review_tokens":["i","would","not","recommend","this","game","for","everyone","if","you","just","want","a","simple","push","button","to","hack","the","game","will","be","pretty","boring","you","can","buy","hacks","in","the","shop","and","proceed","though","the","storyless","game","still","being","worked","on","i","really","would","not","recommend","if","this","is","what","you","want","in","this","game","you","can","make","your","own","scripts","and","can","go","so","far","beyond","a","normal","hacking","game","you","can","automate","everything","as","you","would","in","real","life","you","can","type","one","command","and","literally","have","the","entire","hacking","process","automated","this","is","not","real","life","in","any","way","the","hacking","is","quick","and","painless","but","it","follows","the","general","ideas","well","and","it","feels","legit","as","you","play","it","uplink","and","this","game","are","my","two","favs","one","the","big","hollywood","style","and","this","game","trying","to","offer","you","a","sim","without","needing","a","diploma"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["would","recommend","everyone","want","simple","push","button","hack","pretty","boring","buy","hacks","shop","proceed","though","storyless","still","worked","really","would","recommend","want","make","scripts","go","far","beyond","normal","hacking","automate","everything","would","real","life","type","one","command","literally","entire","hacking","process","automated","real","life","way","hacking","quick","painless","follows","general","ideas","well","feels","legit","play","uplink","two","favs","one","big","hollywood","style","trying","offer","sim","without","needing","diploma"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"would recommend everyone want simple push button hack pretty boring buy hacks shop proceed though storyless still worked really would recommend want make scripts go far beyond normal hacking automate everything would real life type one command literally entire hacking process automated real life way hacking quick painless follows general ideas well feels legit play uplink two favs one big hollywood style trying offer sim without needing diploma","retention_score":0.2712812569,"retention_score_scaled":0.4891814801}

I did encounter an issue where the email containing the hacker store IP address randomly got deleted and I had to start over which was pretty annoying but nothing too major as I wasn't too far along. The commands are pretty accurate from what I've experienced messing around with Kali Linux though since it is just a game it's not a 1 to 1 recreation for obvious reasons. Over all I would say this is worth the current price of 15 dollars and look forward to adding more hours when I can","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":187,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":103,"author_last_played":1622413933000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0543269231,"log_playtime_forever":5.2364419628,"log_playtime_at_review":4.6443908991,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-1.2189228732,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-1.1836111235,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.550802139,"days_from_last_played_time":961,"review_length":749,"review_word_count":141,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Medium","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9463,"cleaned_review_tokens":["this","game","is","cool","not","super","handholdy","in","the","beginning","so","total","beginners","like","myself","could","easily","get","confused","but","at","the","same","time","with","a","little","work","its","not","hard","to","get","stuff","done","for","sure","could","use","some","other","features","the","web","aspect","is","pretty","bare","bones","i","did","encounter","an","issue","where","the","email","containing","the","hacker","store","ip","address","randomly","got","deleted","and","i","had","to","start","over","which","was","pretty","annoying","but","nothing","too","major","as","i","wasnt","too","far","along","the","commands","are","pretty","accurate","from","what","ive","experienced","messing","around","with","kali","linux","though","since","it","is","just","a","game","its","not","a","to","recreation","for","obvious","reasons","over","all","i","would","say","this","is","worth","the","current","price","of","dollars","and","look","forward","to","adding","more","hours","when","i","can"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["cool","super","handholdy","beginning","total","beginners","like","could","easily","get","confused","time","little","work","hard","get","stuff","done","sure","could","use","features","web","aspect","pretty","bare","bones","encounter","issue","email","containing","hacker","store","ip","address","randomly","got","deleted","start","pretty","annoying","nothing","major","wasnt","far","along","commands","pretty","accurate","ive","experienced","messing","around","kali","linux","though","since","recreation","obvious","reasons","would","say","worth","current","price","dollars","look","forward","adding","hours"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"cool super handholdy beginning total beginners like could easily get confused time little work hard get stuff done sure could use features web aspect pretty bare bones encounter issue email containing hacker store ip address randomly got deleted start pretty annoying nothing major wasnt far along commands pretty accurate ive experienced messing around kali linux though since recreation obvious reasons would say worth current price dollars look forward adding hours","retention_score":0.1569020288,"retention_score_scaled":0.4089751619}

{"review":"This game is absolutely amazing. I'm a certified Pentester (Ethical Hacker) to which I decided to test this game out thinking it would be all jokes and unrealistic stuff. I was honestly so wrong! The realism behind this game is amazing! Now yes obviously things are simplified and changed, as for example the 'metaxploit.so' library, in real the name of this tool is Metasploit coded by Rapid7. It's a great game to do hacking WHILE playing, I often complete CTF (Capture The Flag, small hacking games by hacking machines) and I feel weird for not hacking after finished it, but with Gray Hack I don't feel that way! Plus Gray Hack also offers a custom coding language called GrayScript\/GreyScript which makes it so fun to code  your own hacking tools, exploits and so on (which is what I did since I also know coding for IRL tools). However, the fun doesn't come down to the realism or coding but also to the things you can do! Hack websites, players, missions, pivot into networks, bypass security systems and so on (while keeping it simple for non real-hackers!). Overall, I love this game and highly recommend it!","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":12496,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":1056,"author_last_played":1681208502000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0021367521,"log_playtime_forever":9.4332438945,"log_playtime_at_review":6.9631899859,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":1.1871735844,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.2765840756,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.0845070423,"days_from_last_played_time":281,"review_length":1117,"review_word_count":195,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9872,"cleaned_review_tokens":["this","game","is","absolutely","amazing","im","a","certified","pentester","ethical","hacker","to","which","i","decided","to","test","this","game","out","thinking","it","would","be","all","jokes","and","unrealistic","stuff","i","was","honestly","so","wrong","the","realism","behind","this","game","is","amazing","now","yes","obviously","things","are","simplified","and","changed","as","for","example","the","metaxploitso","library","in","real","the","name","of","this","tool","is","metasploit","coded","by","rapid","its","a","great","game","to","do","hacking","while","playing","i","often","complete","ctf","capture","the","flag","small","hacking","games","by","hacking","machines","and","i","feel","weird","for","not","hacking","after","finished","it","but","with","gray","hack","i","dont","feel","that","way","plus","gray","hack","also","offers","a","custom","coding","language","called","grayscriptgreyscript","which","makes","it","so","fun","to","code","your","own","hacking","tools","exploits","and","so","on","which","is","what","i","did","since","i","also","know","coding","for","irl","tools","however","the","fun","doesnt","come","down","to","the","realism","or","coding","but","also","to","the","things","you","can","do","hack","websites","players","missions","pivot","into","networks","bypass","security","systems","and","so","on","while","keeping","it","simple","for","non","realhackers","overall","i","love","this","game","and","highly","recommend","it"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["absolutely","amazing","im","certified","pentester","ethical","hacker","decided","test","thinking","would","jokes","unrealistic","stuff","honestly","wrong","realism","behind","amazing","yes","obviously","things","simplified","changed","example","metaxploitso","library","real","name","tool","metasploit","coded","rapid","great","hacking","playing","often","complete","ctf","capture","flag","small","hacking","games","hacking","machines","feel","weird","hacking","finished","gray","hack","dont","feel","way","plus","gray","hack","also","offers","custom","coding","language","called","grayscriptgreyscript","makes","fun","code","hacking","tools","exploits","since","also","know","coding","irl","tools","however","fun","doesnt","come","realism","coding","also","things","hack","websites","players","missions","pivot","networks","bypass","security","systems","keeping","simple","non","realhackers","overall","love","highly","recommend"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"absolutely amazing im certified pentester ethical hacker decided test thinking would jokes unrealistic stuff honestly wrong realism behind amazing yes obviously things simplified changed example metaxploitso library real name tool metasploit coded rapid great hacking playing often complete ctf capture flag small hacking games hacking machines feel weird hacking finished gray hack dont feel way plus gray hack also offers custom coding language called grayscriptgreyscript makes fun code hacking tools exploits since also know coding irl tools however fun doesnt come realism coding also things hack websites players missions pivot networks bypass security systems keeping simple non realhackers overall love highly recommend","retention_score":0.3901123109,"retention_score_scaled":0.5725095589}

{"review":"Ever wanted to feel how it is to be a real hacker and face and overcome the difficulties that come with being one?\n\nThis game is probably the closest you can get without actually having any prior experience with the technicalities that are involved with gaining illegal access to a person's computer. \n\nWhat really sets this game apart from every other in this genre, is that while portrayal in most games is very 'Hollywood-esque', this game manages to keep it grounded and convincingly portrays the 'real feel' of being a hacker, and the difficulties that must be overcome. In-game computer actually feels genuine and intuitive to use, and unlike in many other games, gaining unauthorized access to a person's computer is in itself a very rewarding process. It actually feels like the real deal (and the methods and concepts such as social engineering that exist in the game are all real). \n\nAnother major 'wow' factor is that the in-game world is alive. People go to work in the morning, system administrators keep an eye out for any suspicious behaviour when online. Planning your time of attack can be the difference between evasion and being caught. Computers are connected to routers and switches, creating networks that can be hacked. It's absolutely insane.\n\nThe cherry on top? It's a world you can just roam around and utilize. If you can think of hacking something, it can be done.\n\nThe tools (software) you use and the ways you can attack your victim also differ per computer, you always need to adapt and find new ways, there's no magical command-line that does it all. You need to figure it out yourself, and that's the idea and the notion the game stands on. It's not an action game like Hacknet or Uplink, but rather it's a puzzle game where it's up to you to figure out how to \"win\".\n\nIf you ever wanted to feel what it's like to be a real hacker, this game is it.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.691976070404052734","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":8896,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":2854,"author_last_played":1697277089000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0130050505,"log_playtime_forever":9.0934694202,"log_playtime_at_review":7.9568271221,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.9923752184,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.9022976978,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.3208183453,"days_from_last_played_time":95,"review_length":1881,"review_word_count":332,"engagement_score":17,"playtime_category":"Very

I started learning programming just because I wanted to understand this game. :D This was one year ago and I didn't find much time to play GreyHack because I had to finish my Python course. After Python I enrolled to Java, now at the time learning GUI development with JavaFX. All started just because I wanted to play this game. :D\n\nDoesn't mean you need to be a programmer to play this game but also it's not that easy. The tutorial is fine and lots of functions are explained well but don't an expect an easy start. If you are interessted in programming, hacking and willing to take ur time to learn, to read, to ask this game is really really satisfying.

{"review":"This game has a pretty interesting way of generating \"vulnerabilities\" that can be \"exploited\" and offers a user interface based on real UNIX commands. Unfortunately, those commands are so watered down and poorly implemented, they're almost completely useless. For example: Commands do not accept wildcards.\n\nThere's a scripting language so you could in theory write your own set of tools to replace the standard ones. Unfortunately, the scripting language still lacks the possibility to include code from other files, which means you will find yourself copy\/pasting the same code over and over and over again if you want to replace all the shell commands that make up the CLI user experience.\n\nI spent some time on this game about a year ago doing exactly that, before I tired of it. Checking back a year later, I find that none of these issues have been addressed, and I have to say at this point I doubt they ever will.\n\nEDIT: I'm happy to see they finally did!

The lack of content really ruins the depth of the game, and you end up doing the same thing over and over. \n\nThe game tries to be much like Uplink, but Uplink worked by having a hackers server where you got your mail, software, and missions... This game expects you to search for what you need, find a generic named website, and buy the tools from the same generic web store page. \n\nDev needs to flesh out the web content.\nNeeds to sharpen, and modernize the GUI.\nNeeds multiple story lines.\n\nFor being out 3 years old and $15 it needs a lot of work.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":446,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":192,"author_last_played":1662681845000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.0176811594,"log_playtime_forever":6.1025585946,"log_playtime_at_review":5.2626901889,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-0.7223637805,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-0.7942554179,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.4304932735,"days_from_last_played_time":495,"review_length":907,"review_word_count":167,"engagement_score":1,"playtime_category":"Medium","reviewer_experience":"Experienced","vader_sentiment":-0.4835,"cleaned_review_tokens":["interesting","game","but","its","been","years","still","in","early","access","and","the","content","is","very","shallow","the","complexity","and","realism","is","high","and","in","some","instances","simplified","but","still","tries","to","be","very","realistic","the","web","content","needs","a","lot","of","work","to","make","the","game","more","complete","and","the","dev","is","mostly","working","on","programming","and","scripting","aspects","and","bugs","the","lack","of","content","really","ruins","the","depth","of","the","game","and","you","end","up","doing","the","same","thing","over","and","over","the","game","tries","to","be","much","like","uplink","but","uplink","worked","by","having","a","hackers","server","where","you","got","your","mail","software","and","missions","this","game","expects","you","to","search","for","what","you","need","find","a","generic","named","website","and","buy","the","tools","from","the","same","generic","web","store","page","dev","needs","to","flesh","out","the","web","content","needs","to","sharpen","and","modernize","the","gui","needs","multiple","story","lines","for","being","out","years","old","and","it","needs","a","lot","of","work"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["interesting","years","still","early","access","content","shallow","complexity","realism","high","instances","simplified","still","tries","realistic","web","content","needs","lot","work","make","complete","dev","mostly","working","programming","scripting","aspects","bugs","lack","content","really","ruins","depth","end","thing","tries","much","like","uplink","uplink","worked","hackers","server","got","mail","software","missions","expects","search","need","find","generic","named","website","buy","tools","generic","web","store","page","dev","needs","flesh","web","content","needs","sharpen","modernize","gui","needs","multiple","story","lines","years","old","needs","lot","work"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"interesting years still early access content shallow complexity realism high instances simplified still tries realistic web content needs lot work make complete dev mostly working programming scripting aspects bugs lack content really ruins depth end thing tries much like uplink uplink worked hackers server got mail software missions expects search need find generic named website buy tools generic web store page dev needs flesh web content needs sharpen modernize gui needs multiple story lines years old needs lot work","retention_score":0.0007681893,"retention_score_scaled":0.2994891946}

{"review":"TLDR:\nThe best game I ever played regarding simulation & hacking generally. 10\/10\n\nI like how creative one can get regarding exploitation & automation of the task execution. \nI mean I'm new in the game so I didn't try everything yet - but I was able to to make e.g. my own regex system.\n\nPretty hardcore for no IT guys though. Like tutorial hints are pretty original - hack the wifi of your neighbour. After that you are on your own. I think I'm a very good programmer-but I have like very limited knowledge of the hacking itself.

{"review":"tl;dr:  This is a top-tier scripting game, and just an ok to good hacking game.\n\nThis game is one of my favorites in the hacking genre.  It does an fairly good job of keeping a sense of reality, while also remembering it's a game.  The concepts in focus with this one (multiplayer, scripting, more realism) are executed well and are done in a way that contributes to the game's overall quality, and set it apart as something unique in a genre of close clones.  It is also refreshing to have the computer upgrades come back, as I don't recall a title that really used them since Uplink.\n\nFor EA: Updates are frequent and meaningful, however it really gives the impression there are two development tracks.  And here's where things get rocky.  The vast majority of the updates are centered around the in-game scripting system.  Which is superbly powerful and well executed.  However the updates to the actual game part of the content are a bit fewer in between.  And the downside to this is it really feels like a scripting game more than it does a hacking game at times.  While yes, you can play the game without ever coding a line, it does get tedious.  The steps are many, and a bit paint by number.  It begs to be scripted.  Which you'll be compelled to do.  Then you'll wonder why you don't script everything.  And you'll want to code pages to accomplish all you need to do.  And you'll script yourself right out of playing the game, and realize you spent all your hours in Sublime automating your fun away.  Or maybe that's just me.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543874919414520264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":6568,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":905,"author_last_played":1700258898000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0550223214,"log_playtime_forever":8.7901168929,"log_playtime_at_review":6.809039306,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.8184581612,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.1795122404,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.1377892814,"days_from_last_played_time":60,"review_length":1536,"review_word_count":276,"engagement_score":3,"playtime_category":"Very

As a professional in the IT \/ Cyber Security field with ethical pen testing, Linux, and coding experience\/knowledge, this is by far an the most realistic hacking simulator game out there that I have discovered.

Highly Recommend. \n\nGreat way to learn Linux, cyber security, hacking, etc. Wouldn't recommend if your not into technology.  \n\nSome cool idea to add ( This might be in there - I probably just haven't discovered  - Played 3.6 as of post )\n- Backups\n- Cloud document save ( a folder documents location can sync to multiplayer section from single player - Like in game notes app )\n- Cloud VM \/ networking \/ app virtualization\n- Botnets\n- DDOS \/ DOS attacks\n- Server hardware power outages\n- Windows like OS devices\n- Mobile phones\n- Etc.\n","voted_up":1,"votes_up":46,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.826216697692871094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":1821,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":218,"author_last_played":1665872695000,"textblob_sentiment":0.1936904762,"log_playtime_forever":7.5076900778,"log_playtime_at_review":5.3890717298,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.0832215055,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-0.7146703774,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.1197144426,"days_from_last_played_time":458,"review_length":988,"review_word_count":176,"engagement_score":46,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9934,"cleaned_review_tokens":["so","i","never","leave","reviews","for","steam","games","but","this","is","truly","amazing","as","a","professional","in","the","it","cyber","security","field","with","ethical","pen","testing","linux","and","coding","experienceknowledge","this","is","by","far","an","the","most","realistic","hacking","simulator","game","out","there","that","i","have","discovered","as","being","in","early","release","i","am","very","excited","and","supportive","to","what","the","developers","do","with","upcoming","updates","still","learning","as","only","played","hours","stars","so","far","highly","recommend","great","way","to","learn","linux","cyber","security","hacking","etc","wouldnt","recommend","if","your","not","into","technology","some","cool","idea","to","add","this","might","be","in","there","i","probably","just","havent","discovered","played","as","of","post","backups","cloud","document","save","a","folder","documents","location","can","sync","to","multiplayer","section","from","single","player","like","in","game","notes","app","cloud","vm","networking","app","virtualization","botnets","ddos","dos","attacks","server","hardware","power","outages","windows","like","os","devices","mobile","phones","etc"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["never","leave","reviews","steam","games","truly","amazing","professional","cyber","security","field","ethical","pen","testing","linux","coding","experienceknowledge","far","realistic","hacking","simulator","discovered","early","release","excited","supportive","developers","upcoming","updates","still","learning","played","hours","stars","far","highly","recommend","great","way","learn","linux","cyber","security","hacking","etc","wouldnt","recommend","technology","cool","idea","add","might","probably","havent","discovered","played","post","backups","cloud","document","save","folder","documents","location","sync","multiplayer","section","single","player","like","notes","app","cloud","vm","networking","app","virtualization","botnets","ddos","dos","attacks","server","hardware","power","outages","windows","like","os","devices","mobile","phones","etc"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"never leave reviews steam games truly amazing professional cyber security field ethical pen testing linux coding experienceknowledge far realistic hacking simulator discovered early release excited supportive developers upcoming updates still learning played hours stars far highly recommend great way learn linux cyber security hacking etc wouldnt recommend technology cool idea add might probably havent discovered played post backups cloud document save folder documents location sync multiplayer section single player like notes app cloud vm networking app virtualization botnets ddos dos attacks server hardware power outages windows like os devices mobile phones etc","retention_score":0.3013090146,"retention_score_scaled":0.5102378899}

{"review":"Do you enjoy hacking games? This game truly aims to provide a semi-realistic hacking experience. There's a lot interesting mechanics in development: from dynamic networks, exploits, phishing, a scripting language and more. Also, the world is persistent which is also really cool. If you have even a passing interest in hacking, ITSEC\/OPSEC this is a fascinating playground.\n\n[b]Do you need to be a programmer to play?[\/b] No, but it helps. In fact, I would say this is a fun way to learn how programming works.\n\n[b]Do you need to be a hacker to play?[\/b] No, but again, this is a neat way to learn basic hacking concepts. \n\n[b]Does the game hold your hand?[\/b[ At the time of writing (8-July-2020), no. You're going to need to do some exploring. You're going to need check out the resources the developer provides and especially check out the Discord channel and forums.\n\n[b]This is early access, how early are we talking?[\/b] [i]Pretty early.[\/i] Every core mechanic is still in development, and there are bugs. But the nightly updates channel is updated extremely often. This developer loves this project, and it shows. If you are cautious of buying EA games, I don't blame you, but I think this is a safe bet.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":2930,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":1456,"author_last_played":1690125974000,"textblob_sentiment":0.1683333333,"log_playtime_forever":7.9830989407,"log_playtime_at_review":7.2841348062,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.355781326,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.4786895915,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.4969283276,"days_from_last_played_time":177,"review_length":1212,"review_word_count":207,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Veteran","vader_sentiment":0.9749,"cleaned_review_tokens":["do","you","enjoy","hacking","games","this","game","truly","aims","to","provide","a","semirealistic","hacking","experience","theres","a","lot","interesting","mechanics","in","development","from","dynamic","networks","exploits","phishing","a","scripting","language","and","more","also","the","world","is","persistent","which","is","also","really","cool","if","you","have","even","a","passing","interest","in","hacking","itsecopsec","this","is","a","fascinating","playground","bdo","you","need","to","be","a","programmer","to","playb","no","but","it","helps","in","fact","i","would","say","this","is","a","fun","way","to","learn","how","programming","works","bdo","you","need","to","be","a","hacker","to","playb","no","but","again","this","is","a","neat","way","to","learn","basic","hacking","concepts","bdoes","the","game","hold","your","handb","at","the","time","of","writing","july","no","youre","going","to","need","to","do","some","exploring","youre","going","to","need","check","out","the","resources","the","developer","provides","and","especially","check","out","the","discord","channel","and","forums","bthis","is","early","access","how","early","are","we","talkingb","ipretty","earlyi","every","core","mechanic","is","still","in","development","and","there","are","bugs","but","the","nightly","updates","channel","is","updated","extremely","often","this","developer","loves","this","project","and","it","shows","if","you","are","cautious","of","buying","ea","games","i","dont","blame","you","but","i","think","this","is","a","safe","bet"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["enjoy","hacking","games","truly","aims","provide","semirealistic","hacking","experience","theres","lot","interesting","mechanics","development","dynamic","networks","exploits","phishing","scripting","language","also","world","persistent","also","really","cool","even","passing","interest","hacking","itsecopsec","fascinating","playground","bdo","need","programmer","playb","helps","fact","would","say","fun","way","learn","programming","works","bdo","need","hacker","playb","neat","way","learn","basic","hacking","concepts","bdoes","hold","handb","time","writing","july","youre","going","need","exploring","youre","going","need","check","resources","developer","provides","especially","check","discord","channel","forums","bthis","early","access","early","talkingb","ipretty","earlyi","every","core","mechanic","still","development","bugs","nightly","updates","channel","updated","extremely","often","developer","loves","project","shows","cautious","buying","ea","games","dont","blame","think","safe","bet"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"enjoy hacking games truly aims provide semirealistic hacking experience theres lot interesting mechanics development dynamic networks exploits phishing scripting language also world persistent also really cool even passing interest hacking itsecopsec fascinating playground bdo need programmer playb helps fact would say fun way learn programming works bdo need hacker playb neat way learn basic hacking concepts bdoes hold handb time writing july youre going need exploring youre going need check resources developer provides especially check discord channel forums bthis early access early talkingb ipretty earlyi every core mechanic still development bugs nightly updates channel updated extremely often developer loves project shows cautious buying ea games dont blame think safe bet","retention_score":0.3324541791,"retention_score_scaled":0.5320778604}

{"review":"Yeah it's good when it works. It's not so great when it doesn't work. Looking forward to when this game get's some more polish on it and it'll be a great step in the right direction.

{"review":"I have spent 13 hours or so on this game and find it totally engrossing. The scripting in this is based on 'miniscript' an open source scripting language and what the developer has done with this is simply amazing.

{"review":"I've enjoyed the \"hacking sim\" of games for quite a while. I found Hacknet and Uplink to be very entertaining. Once I was finished with those games I needed something else and that's when I found Grey Hack. This tapes into that want for great, complex games that are also not too hard to the point where you cannot play but not too easy to the point where playing the game feels like an amature experience. The game is in early access and has bugs and \"missing content\" however the game receives a lot of support from the devs and after looking at the roadmap and the current state of the game I truly am hopeful that when this comes out of early access it will be up there with Hacknet and Uplink.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":1987,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":873,"author_last_played":1656367734000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0094444444,"log_playtime_forever":7.5948843872,"log_playtime_at_review":6.7730803757,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.1332114556,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.1568681667,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.4393558128,"days_from_last_played_time":568,"review_length":698,"review_word_count":133,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Experienced","vader_sentiment":0.9522,"cleaned_review_tokens":["ive","enjoyed","the","hacking","sim","of","games","for","quite","a","while","i","found","hacknet","and","uplink","to","be","very","entertaining","once","i","was","finished","with","those","games","i","needed","something","else","and","thats","when","i","found","grey","hack","this","tapes","into","that","want","for","great","complex","games","that","are","also","not","too","hard","to","the","point","where","you","can","not","play","but","not","too","easy","to","the","point","where","playing","the","game","feels","like","an","amature","experience","the","game","is","in","early","access","and","has","bugs","and","missing","content","however","the","game","receives","a","lot","of","support","from","the","devs","and","after","looking","at","the","roadmap","and","the","current","state","of","the","game","i","truly","am","hopeful","that","when","this","comes","out","of","early","access","it","will","be","up","there","with","hacknet","and","uplink"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["ive","enjoyed","hacking","sim","games","quite","found","hacknet","uplink","entertaining","finished","games","needed","something","else","thats","found","grey","hack","tapes","want","great","complex","games","also","hard","point","play","easy","point","playing","feels","like","amature","experience","early","access","bugs","missing","content","however","receives","lot","support","devs","looking","roadmap","current","state","truly","hopeful","comes","early","access","hacknet","uplink"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"ive enjoyed hacking sim games quite found hacknet uplink entertaining finished games needed something else thats found grey hack tapes want great complex games also hard point play easy point playing feels like amature experience early access bugs missing content however receives lot support devs looking roadmap current state truly hopeful comes early access hacknet uplink","retention_score":0.285104282,"retention_score_scaled":0.4988746208}

{"review":"At the moment of writing, there's a bug that's causing the game to crash back into the game menu. But otherwise there isn't really much to complain. The way the game works, the terminal and its commands, is very close and accurate to the real thing, just simplified in a lot of aspects. Most of the missions currently available are hack and run situations, aside from server hosting jobs. Make a mistake however, you're very screwed if you miss what mistake you did. When I first started playing I was a nervous wreck on making a single mistake, but overtime it just becomes something that you can quickly overcome; you understand the concept, the commands and what it does and the methods to get every job done.\n\nIt would be fun if there were more features or even a story mode for single player. I admire the developer for working hard on this Alpha and have my full support doing so. Worth the money I decided to spend on this game (out of impulse lmao). Definitely gonna put more hours into this game every once in a while.\n\nI do agree however there should be more to the tutorial and manual especially if the player has little to no experience in hacking or being in a Unix environment. It's what makes them regret buying the game. There are several helpful tutorials on the internet but they never really do cover the entire aspects of the game. It's the basics, and you will have to make do from then on.\n\nLooking forward to future developments and improvements to the game.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":1298,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":982,"author_last_played":1697358808000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0517517007,"log_playtime_forever":7.1693500167,"log_playtime_at_review":6.8906091201,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-0.1107544876,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.2308784203,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.7565485362,"days_from_last_played_time":94,"review_length":1481,"review_word_count":269,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Experienced","vader_sentiment":-0.4639,"cleaned_review_tokens":["at","the","moment","of","writing","theres","a","bug","thats","causing","the","game","to","crash","back","into","the","game","menu","but","otherwise","there","isnt","really","much","to","complain","the","way","the","game","works","the","terminal","and","its","commands","is","very","close","and","accurate","to","the","real","thing","just","simplified","in","a","lot","of","aspects","most","of","the","missions","currently","available","are","hack","and","run","situations","aside","from","server","hosting","jobs","make","a","mistake","however","youre","very","screwed","if","you","miss","what","mistake","you","did","when","i","first","started","playing","i","was","a","nervous","wreck","on","making","a","single","mistake","but","overtime","it","just","becomes","something","that","you","can","quickly","overcome","you","understand","the","concept","the","commands","and","what","it","does","and","the","methods","to","get","every","job","done","it","would","be","fun","if","there","were","more","features","or","even","a","story","mode","for","single","player","i","admire","the","developer","for","working","hard","on","this","alpha","and","have","my","full","support","doing","so","worth","the","money","i","decided","to","spend","on","this","game","out","of","impulse","lmao","definitely","gon","na","put","more","hours","into","this","game","every","once","in","a","while","i","do","agree","however","there","should","be","more","to","the","tutorial","and","manual","especially","if","the","player","has","little","to","no","experience","in","hacking","or","being","in","a","unix","environment","its","what","makes","them","regret","buying","the","game","there","are","several","helpful","tutorials","on","the","internet","but","they","never","really","do","cover","the","entire","aspects","of","the","game","its","the","basics","and","you","will","have","to","make","do","from","then","on","looking","forward","to","future","developments","and","improvements","to","the","game"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["moment","writing","theres","bug","thats","causing","crash","back","menu","otherwise","isnt","really","much","complain","way","works","terminal","commands","close","accurate","real","thing","simplified","lot","aspects","missions","currently","available","hack","run","situations","aside","server","hosting","jobs","make","mistake","however","youre","screwed","miss","mistake","first","started","playing","nervous","wreck","making","single","mistake","overtime","becomes","something","quickly","overcome","understand","concept","commands","methods","get","every","job","done","would","fun","features","even","story","mode","single","player","admire","developer","working","hard","alpha","full","support","worth","money","decided","spend","impulse","lmao","definitely","gon","na","put","hours","every","agree","however","tutorial","manual","especially","player","little","experience","hacking","unix","environment","makes","regret","buying","several","helpful","tutorials","internet","never","really","cover","entire","aspects","basics","make","looking","forward","future","developments","improvements"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"moment writing theres bug thats causing crash back menu otherwise isnt really much complain way works terminal commands close accurate real thing simplified lot aspects missions currently available hack run situations aside server hosting jobs make mistake however youre screwed miss mistake first started playing nervous wreck making single mistake overtime becomes something quickly overcome understand concept commands methods get every job done would fun features even story mode single player admire developer working hard alpha full support worth money decided spend impulse lmao definitely gon na put hours every agree however tutorial manual especially player little experience hacking unix environment makes regret buying several helpful tutorials internet never really cover entire aspects basics make looking forward future developments improvements","retention_score":0.0758229797,"retention_score_scaled":0.3521199782}

{"review":"An interesting and quite different game in the gaming universe. You start with a basic computer and try to score in the world of computer hackers. That happens somewhere in the past, when things where way simpler. There are a number of missions to chose from, and a set of tools you may use. As in the real world, there is actually little help and guidance, so you may figure out by yourself about many things. Challenging and fun. \nThe major drawback is the fact that it is not clear how you are traced back and your deeds discovered by site admins. My intuition is that the games's tracking system is buggy or quite random.\nClearing parts of the logs seems to not enough sometimes for the job. And once caught, you'll lose ALL the progress. There is no way to conserve your progress if caught, you'll have to start over.\nLooking forward for the improvements, it's a promising good game.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":1128,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":520,"author_last_played":1681414891000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0652777778,"log_playtime_forever":7.0290875641,"log_playtime_at_review":6.2557500418,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-0.1911692881,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-0.1689053228,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.4609929078,"days_from_last_played_time":278,"review_length":888,"review_word_count":161,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Experienced","vader_sentiment":0.9405,"cleaned_review_tokens":["an","interesting","and","quite","different","game","in","the","gaming","universe","you","start","with","a","basic","computer","and","try","to","score","in","the","world","of","computer","hackers","that","happens","somewhere","in","the","past","when","things","where","way","simpler","there","are","a","number","of","missions","to","chose","from","and","a","set","of","tools","you","may","use","as","in","the","real","world","there","is","actually","little","help","and","guidance","so","you","may","figure","out","by","yourself","about","many","things","challenging","and","fun","the","major","drawback","is","the","fact","that","it","is","not","clear","how","you","are","traced","back","and","your","deeds","discovered","by","site","admins","my","intuition","is","that","the","gamess","tracking","system","is","buggy","or","quite","random","clearing","parts","of","the","logs","seems","to","not","enough","sometimes","for","the","job","and","once","caught","youll","lose","all","the","progress","there","is","no","way","to","conserve","your","progress","if","caught","youll","have","to","start","over","looking","forward","for","the","improvements","its","a","promising","good","game"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["interesting","quite","different","gaming","universe","start","basic","computer","try","score","world","computer","hackers","happens","somewhere","past","things","way","simpler","number","missions","chose","set","tools","may","use","real","world","actually","little","help","guidance","may","figure","many","things","challenging","fun","major","drawback","fact","clear","traced","back","deeds","discovered","site","admins","intuition","gamess","tracking","system","buggy","quite","random","clearing","parts","logs","seems","enough","sometimes","job","caught","youll","lose","progress","way","conserve","progress","caught","youll","start","looking","forward","improvements","promising","good"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"interesting quite different gaming universe start basic computer try score world computer hackers happens somewhere past things way simpler number missions chose set tools may use real world actually little help guidance may figure many things challenging fun major drawback fact clear traced back deeds discovered site admins intuition gamess tracking system buggy quite random clearing parts logs seems enough sometimes job caught youll lose progress way conserve progress caught youll start looking forward improvements promising good","retention_score":0.2723369034,"retention_score_scaled":0.4899217327}

{"review":"So as you can see from my hrs on record I am obsessed with this game.  However that is not why I chose to write a review.  I have wrote very few reviews on games.  It's just not really my deal.  It takes a lot for me to write something either good or bad about it.  And I had that \"a lot\" moment recently when I was interacting with another player in the game.  I was talking to them about how much I enjoyed the game and have over 400 hours in to it.  That's when I realized I have almost 500 now.... in a game that's still in alpha.  The game doesn't even have all the features yet and has many bugs.  There's a running contest in discord for who can find the most bugs.  Normally that's a bad thing for a game.  But this game... the bugs are actually fun and in a weird way add to the game.  Don't get me wrong the developer is constantly pushing out updates and actively fixing those bugs and making the game better with each update.  But the bugs are used in the game for hacking.  Players adapt to the more stubborn bugs and you learn to protect yourself from them.  You find others and use those to mess around.  I wish I could explain better how and why this game has sucked me in but this game is one massive world where the players create so much of the content without realizing it, \"500 hours in an alpha\" kind of not realizing it.  That was my \"a lot\" moment.  I paid 10$ for 500 hours of game play.  I have games in my library that I've paid far more for and have far fewer hours and they're still worth it to me and those are finished!  So as a thank you for the best 10$ I've ever spent here's my Review Kuro I hope it helps drive more sales to ya.\n\nJust so this isn't just a gushing fan girl review of Kuro's (the dev yes it's made by one guy as far as I know) work.  I will point out the one real shortcoming of the game.  The learning curve is more like a learning cliff.  Most of the game takes place in the terminal, reading through lines of code, hunting for weaknesses in the smallest of places and getting annoyed for hours that you can't figure it out.  Only to finally get that hack and leave a surprise for your target.  That's it.  That's the only reward. Fulfillment. For a sometimes very hard game where you set your own challenges, loose everything and start over again and again.  This is an amazing game for a select group of people.  But if you ever wanted to feel as close to being an actual White, Black or Grey hat as you can without taking the real risks then this game might be for you.  \n\nAnd don't worry if you do want to jump in.  We are friendly and willing to help.  I'll be more then happy to teach you the tricks.  Get you up to speed.  Steal your server then give it back to you and let ya know how I did it so you can make it harder and more challenging for me the next time.  Come play.  My name in game is Lady so feel free to say \"hi\".  And remember it's not polite to keep a Lady waiting.\n\n*** Update ***\n\nSo 800 something hours into this game and coming up on a year later.  A lot has changed in this game.  Scripting is a big part now, nightly has billions (literally the whole of IPV4 is available)  of targets.  Exploits are creative and interesting.  It's still a great game and honestly one that I'll probably play till I can't any more.  There's so much of my time and energy invested into here.  Friends that I've met and connections that I've made.  Kuro is a great guy and worth putting your support behind.  The game still has a pretty tough learning curve.  There's a better tutorial and guides to help.  But the game has also become more complex.  It will make you think.  It'll make you feel dumb.  It'll make you feel awesome and also annoy the hell out of you.  If you get through the lost feeling at the start you'll start to realize the depth the game has to offer.  Give the game a chance or join our discord and ask questions before buying.

{"review":"I have played this game since SSHNuke was still a thing and I recently came back to it, It has evolved a lot since then and by a lot I mean a ton. Of course with improvements it has also become more complex and added things like programming, exploits and much more. I could say It's somewhat hard for people who don't have any prior experience with coding or UNIX commands to pick up but it's not impossible to learn through simply playing the game and experimenting and once you get the hang of everything it's actually pretty fun. Despite the repetitiveness in missions and whatnot the multiplayer is a breath of fresh air allowing the community to cooperate in making an enjoyable experience for everyone, that or getting your bank account's savings be stolen and afterwards having to boot up into safe mode. Creating your own programs no matter how simple they may be or defacing a website for the hell of it is a thing of joy.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":9022,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":4887,"author_last_played":1682200934000,"textblob_sentiment":0.1439583333,"log_playtime_forever":9.107532152,"log_playtime_at_review":8.4945385009,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":1.0004376168,"normalized_playtime_at_review":1.240905548,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.5416759033,"days_from_last_played_time":269,"review_length":931,"review_word_count":169,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9558,"cleaned_review_tokens":["i","have","played","this","game","since","sshnuke","was","still","a","thing","and","i","recently","came","back","to","it","it","has","evolved","a","lot","since","then","and","by","a","lot","i","mean","a","ton","of","course","with","improvements","it","has","also","become","more","complex","and","added","things","like","programming","exploits","and","much","more","i","could","say","its","somewhat","hard","for","people","who","dont","have","any","prior","experience","with","coding","or","unix","commands","to","pick","up","but","its","not","impossible","to","learn","through","simply","playing","the","game","and","experimenting","and","once","you","get","the","hang","of","everything","its","actually","pretty","fun","despite","the","repetitiveness","in","missions","and","whatnot","the","multiplayer","is","a","breath","of","fresh","air","allowing","the","community","to","cooperate","in","making","an","enjoyable","experience","for","everyone","that","or","getting","your","bank","accounts","savings","be","stolen","and","afterwards","having","to","boot","up","into","safe","mode","creating","your","own","programs","no","matter","how","simple","they","may","be","or","defacing","a","website","for","the","hell","of","it","is","a","thing","of","joy"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["played","since","sshnuke","still","thing","recently","came","back","evolved","lot","since","lot","mean","ton","course","improvements","also","become","complex","added","things","like","programming","exploits","much","could","say","somewhat","hard","people","dont","prior","experience","coding","unix","commands","pick","impossible","learn","simply","playing","experimenting","get","hang","everything","actually","pretty","fun","despite","repetitiveness","missions","whatnot","multiplayer","breath","fresh","air","allowing","community","cooperate","making","enjoyable","experience","everyone","getting","bank","accounts","savings","stolen","afterwards","boot","safe","mode","creating","programs","matter","simple","may","defacing","website","hell","thing","joy"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"played since sshnuke still thing recently came back evolved lot since lot mean ton course improvements also become complex added things like programming exploits much could say somewhat hard people dont prior experience coding unix commands pick impossible learn simply playing experimenting get hang everything actually pretty fun despite repetitiveness missions whatnot multiplayer breath fresh air allowing community cooperate making enjoyable experience everyone getting bank accounts savings stolen afterwards boot safe mode creating programs matter simple may defacing website hell thing joy","retention_score":0.3775780688,"retention_score_scaled":0.5637201535}

{"review":"(UPDATED)\n\nMy Review of Grey Hack:\n\n(Since it's in Early Access as of this Review)\nall in all 9\/10\ni Really Enjoy this Game\n\nPros:\n- Lots of Pros -\n\n - Commands -\n nmap and all the Other Programs Have a Real Live CounterPart and are very Similar in some Ways.\n\nfor example nmap in game and in real life is used for mapping a ip or a Network:\n\nin Game:\"nmap [ip]\"\nin real Life nmap has alot of different options:\nin real life: \"nmap -s -sa [IP]\"\n\n[the in real life nmap options is a little Different but you get the idea]\n\n- Customizing -\nI'm happy with being able to change the look and feel.\n\n- (Most) Jobs in the Hack Shop -\ni really like most of the Jobs but there is one in mind that i don't\n(will be in Cons)\n\n- ECT -\nin my Opinion Most of the Programs are easy to use and easy to Do what you Want with to get the Job done.\n\nCons:\n- 4 Cons -\n\n- Level System -\nwhen i Started Playing this Game i Didn't Expect a Level System to be in a Hacking Simulator.\n(but i get its for Game play)\n\n- Job in the Hack Store -\nthe Corrupt Data Missions can be Hard to do sometimes and should be a little easier to Do.\n\n- Money -\nit's hard to Come by in this Game since most of your Money at the Beginning is from Banks. \n\n-Getting Caught\nwhen you get Caught its End Game, it's a Little upsetting but i get it.\n\n- Conclusion -\n\nso in conclusion i Really Enjoy Playing this Game but it Has some Faults about it\n(but since its in Early Access my views could change)\n\np.s i Can't wait to see what Future Update's will bring to the

{"review":"This game is amazing. Yes, it's hard at first, when you don't have a single clue what to do. But after that, you finally know the commands and its like re-living hacking scenes from all your favorite movies. My only suggestion to the developer, don't make accessing the deep web so easy, instead of just copy pasting an IP, make the player download a much slower browser, like TOR, for example. But don't put it behind a wall so you have to do missions to get to it, you need the hack shops early on.  Yes, I would recommend this game, but only if you like coding, as typing these commands can get boring for a casual gamer.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626257777214050293","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":783,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":462,"author_last_played":1693712428000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.0576330532,"log_playtime_forever":6.6644090204,"log_playtime_at_review":6.1377270541,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-0.4002455721,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-0.2432268114,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.5900383142,"days_from_last_played_time":136,"review_length":624,"review_word_count":118,"engagement_score":7,"playtime_category":"High","reviewer_experience":"Experienced","vader_sentiment":0.9817,"cleaned_review_tokens":["this","game","is","amazing","yes","its","hard","at","first","when","you","dont","have","a","single","clue","what","to","do","but","after","that","you","finally","know","the","commands","and","its","like","reliving","hacking","scenes","from","all","your","favorite","movies","my","only","suggestion","to","the","developer","dont","make","accessing","the","deep","web","so","easy","instead","of","just","copy","pasting","an","ip","make","the","player","download","a","much","slower","browser","like","tor","for","example","but","dont","put","it","behind","a","wall","so","you","have","to","do","missions","to","get","to","it","you","need","the","hack","shops","early","on","yes","i","would","recommend","this","game","but","only","if","you","like","coding","as","typing","these","commands","can","get","boring","for","a","casual","gamer"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["amazing","yes","hard","first","dont","single","clue","finally","know","commands","like","reliving","hacking","scenes","favorite","movies","suggestion","developer","dont","make","accessing","deep","web","easy","instead","copy","pasting","ip","make","player","download","much","slower","browser","like","tor","example","dont","put","behind","wall","missions","get","need","hack","shops","early","yes","would","recommend","like","coding","typing","commands","get","boring","casual","gamer"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"amazing yes hard first dont single clue finally know commands like reliving hacking scenes favorite movies suggestion developer dont make accessing deep web easy instead copy pasting ip make player download much slower browser like tor example dont put behind wall missions get need hack shops early yes would recommend like coding typing commands get boring casual gamer","retention_score":0.2614581352,"retention_score_scaled":0.4822931977}

{"review":"Best Hacking game ever made.\nVery realistic in all the right areas, unrealistic in some due to game balancing.\nSingle Player is very good to get used to everything but the Multiplayer is where the real fun is at.\nBut there are downsides to both.\n\nPros:\n- Real Terminal Commands that reward players for thinking outside the box\n(Such as renaming the 'sudo' command to something else so people can't use it when hacking in to your computer, or finding a real life dictionary.txt file and copying everything into the in-game notepad to run bruteforce)\n- You can create botnets and proxies, hack traffic cameras, change academic records, and even create your own websites with real html code\n- You can buy Hacking Software, or hack the shop to download it for free\n- Multiplayer is where all the fun is at, but there's a downside\n\nCons:\n- All the bank accounts have already been hacked in MP and everyone is such a high level that the software is up to version 7.0 and cost $150\n- Due to high MP levels most computer system also have higher security but you can't hack them because you can't afford the software so it's a catch 22\n- Hardware costs a ridiculous amount of money, a single DDR3 8GB stick is priced at $30,000 to balance the \"End-Game\"\n- There is only one MP server and there are only 2-5 people on at a time\n- No Audio what-so-ever\n\nAll-in-all this game is great and well worth the money.\nIt keeps getting better with each update\nSo click that buy button, download the game, put on some \"Hacking Music\" and fire it

{"review":"I have found Grey Hack to profoundly fun. While still in development, there is much to play with. The missions are not (yet) as exciting as some of those in Uplink, and there is not (yet) an overarching story like in Uplink or Hacknet. But the game is still in development, and it wouldn't be fair to expect all of this just yet.\n\nThe player environment has a Linux GDE feel to it, and many of the commands are borrowed from unix, although with much simpler parameters. Some knowledge of Unix is a real asset for the player, but I shoud think it far from a requirement.\n\nWhat really makes Grey Hack stand out is the multiplayer element, where users can run their own servers, create their own websites, and attempt to compromise each other's activities.\n\nThere is a lot more that I would hope to see from Grey Hack in the long run, but it is still in active development, with regular updates coming out, and new features in the pipeline.

Keep up the good work devs and thank you for providing a roadmap because without that I was not sure if I wanted to get the game.\n\nPros:\nPCs take real Linux commands.\nYou hack like a real hacker using the terminal in a Linux based computer.\nThis is a very strategic game. You have to try out different things so you do not get caught.\n\nCons:\nI cannot think of any cons that this game has in the current state.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":3500,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":1118,"author_last_played":1673070959000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.0605263158,"log_playtime_forever":8.160803921,"log_playtime_at_review":7.0201907083,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.4576625513,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.312478596,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.3194285714,"days_from_last_played_time":375,"review_length":741,"review_word_count":149,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9537,"cleaned_review_tokens":["i","do","not","think","i","have","written","a","review","for","a","game","before","however","this","game","is","the","best","hacking","game","that","i","have","ever","played","i","have","been","looking","for","a","hacking","game","like","this","forever","when","i","first","clicked","into","it","i","was","not","sure","if","i","would","like","it","what","sold","me","was","the","roadmap","that","was","posted","which","definitely","sold","me","on","the","game","keep","up","the","good","work","devs","and","thank","you","for","providing","a","roadmap","because","without","that","i","was","not","sure","if","i","wanted","to","get","the","game","pros","pcs","take","real","linux","commands","you","hack","like","a","real","hacker","using","the","terminal","in","a","linux","based","computer","this","is","a","very","strategic","game","you","have","to","try","out","different","things","so","you","do","not","get","caught","cons","i","can","not","think","of","any","cons","that","this","game","has","in","the","current","state"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["think","written","review","however","best","hacking","ever","played","looking","hacking","like","forever","first","clicked","sure","would","like","sold","roadmap","posted","definitely","sold","keep","good","work","devs","thank","providing","roadmap","without","sure","wanted","get","pros","pcs","take","real","linux","commands","hack","like","real","hacker","using","terminal","linux","based","computer","strategic","try","different","things","get","caught","cons","think","cons","current","state"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"think written review however best hacking ever played looking hacking like forever first clicked sure would like sold roadmap posted definitely sold keep good work devs thank providing roadmap without sure wanted get pros pcs take real linux commands hack like real hacker using terminal linux based computer strategic try different things get caught cons think cons current state","retention_score":0.3173574716,"retention_score_scaled":0.5214915734}

{"review":"I always thought \"Hey, this Hacknet game is the best hacking game available\", but I was probably wrong...\nGrey Hack has the most promissing hacking gameplay I have ever seen.\n\nStarting with Uplink: Hacker Elite I was introduced into this particular genre, and I loved it. Although it lacked many realistic aspects of \"real\" hacking, Uplink made a way for other games like it.\nFollowing, Hacknet was the best hacking game experience I had, and of course it is great. It's huge flaw altough is, that it is purely scripted. It has no sandbox aspect what so ever.\n\nAnd here comes Grey Hack:\nPure Sandbox experience, procedurally generated content and (which is the most promissing), multiplayer.\nAt the moment, it only shows a glance of it's potential, which is great already, but definetily not enough yet.\nBut it has the best perspective for a great game\/simulation:\n\n- Very realistic environment, with a full GUI and terminals with mostly real linux commands\n- Refreshing approach to hacking - no \"PortHack -> Enter\" hollywood style - just get an SSH session going and download some files, decrypt them, or install an http-server on the victims host to create your own exploits, just to name two\n- Greatly integrated UI - you can arrange all windows how you wish, open as many terminals was you want - and you will need it :)\n\nAlthough, this game is surely not for any casual gamer.\nIt still has a very different approach than hacknet for example.\n\nOverall, Grey Hack has huge potential and the published roadmap by the dev seems very promising.\nCertainly keep an eye out for it.\n","voted_up":1,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.708721756935119629","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":529,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":404,"author_last_played":1587739775000,"textblob_sentiment":0.2245386905,"log_playtime_forever":6.2728770065,"log_playtime_at_review":6.0038870671,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-0.6247173977,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-0.3275085879,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.763705104,"days_from_last_played_time":1362,"review_length":1579,"review_word_count":274,"engagement_score":19,"playtime_category":"High","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9962,"cleaned_review_tokens":["i","always","thought","hey","this","hacknet","game","is","the","best","hacking","game","available","but","i","was","probably","wrong","grey","hack","has","the","most","promissing","hacking","gameplay","i","have","ever","seen","starting","with","uplink","hacker","elite","i","was","introduced","into","this","particular","genre","and","i","loved","it","although","it","lacked","many","realistic","aspects","of","real","hacking","uplink","made","a","way","for","other","games","like","it","following","hacknet","was","the","best","hacking","game","experience","i","had","and","of","course","it","is","great","its","huge","flaw","altough","is","that","it","is","purely","scripted","it","has","no","sandbox","aspect","what","so","ever","and","here","comes","grey","hack","pure","sandbox","experience","procedurally","generated","content","and","which","is","the","most","promissing","multiplayer","at","the","moment","it","only","shows","a","glance","of","its","potential","which","is","great","already","but","definetily","not","enough","yet","but","it","has","the","best","perspective","for","a","great","gamesimulation","very","realistic","environment","with","a","full","gui","and","terminals","with","mostly","real","linux","commands","refreshing","approach","to","hacking","no","porthack","enter","hollywood","style","just","get","an","ssh","session","going","and","download","some","files","decrypt","them","or","install","an","httpserver","on","the","victims","host","to","create","your","own","exploits","just","to","name","two","greatly","integrated","ui","you","can","arrange","all","windows","how","you","wish","open","as","many","terminals","was","you","want","and","you","will","need","it","although","this","game","is","surely","not","for","any","casual","gamer","it","still","has","a","very","different","approach","than","hacknet","for","example","overall","grey","hack","has","huge","potential","and","the","published","roadmap","by","the","dev","seems","very","promising","certainly","keep","an","eye","out","for","it"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["always","thought","hey","hacknet","best","hacking","available","probably","wrong","grey","hack","promissing","hacking","gameplay","ever","seen","starting","uplink","hacker","elite","introduced","particular","genre","loved","although","lacked","many","realistic","aspects","real","hacking","uplink","made","way","games","like","following","hacknet","best","hacking","experience","course","great","huge","flaw","altough","purely","scripted","sandbox","aspect","ever","comes","grey","hack","pure","sandbox","experience","procedurally","generated","content","promissing","multiplayer","moment","shows","glance","potential","great","already","definetily","enough","yet","best","perspective","great","gamesimulation","realistic","environment","full","gui","terminals","mostly","real","linux","commands","refreshing","approach","hacking","porthack","enter","hollywood","style","get","ssh","session","going","download","files","decrypt","install","httpserver","victims","host","create","exploits","name","two","greatly","integrated","ui","arrange","windows","wish","open","many","terminals","want","need","although","surely","casual","gamer","still","different","approach","hacknet","example","overall","grey","hack","huge","potential","published","roadmap","dev","seems","promising","certainly","keep","eye"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"always

{"review":"Where do i start.\n\nI do not like things being handed to me on a plate. This game does not do that. The people that seem to think there is no manual are wrong. All the commands you need are in the tutorial along with examples of their use. \n\nThe first thing you must do is hack a Wireless access point to gain access to the internet. This is easily done if you have READ the manual and followed the examples it gives.\n\nWhere this game falls flat is the bugs. The missions are randomly generated which means anyone of the bugs are also randomly generated. This happened to me on the first mission where the admin claimed the user didnt work at his company and the user claimed he didnt know the admin. Since that mission is focused around the social engineering aspect of the game where you would play on the relationship between the two, it falls flat. That was just one bug, but appeared in such a place that i couldnt progress.\n\nThe game and idea of the game is excellent.

{"review":"So far, this is a dream come true and its only in Early Access, can't wait to see what's coming up. \n\nThink Uplink mixed with Hacknet and then throw in a Multiplayer aspect (something I always dreamed of when I was a kid playing Uplink). So I guess you can throw in hackmud for the Multiplayer aspect (just to throw in more names in this niche community). \n\nWhat would be amazing to see is the scripting aspect of hackmud mixed in as well, that would just be the icing on the cake plus the cherry on top. (I'm only 3 hours in so if that is an option, just let me know). \n\nIt needs some smoothing out, sure. But again, this is Early Access so that is More than excusable.

{"review":"I've been playing since the start. It's a great game and as an ethical hack who works in cyber security I can say this is one of the most realistic of this genre. I would love to see some more quality of life improvements. Maybe some basic python scripting and various other methods of hacking. Maybe instead of hacking just other players hacking \"web servers\" that give rewards via xss or some other legit vulns. \n\n\n```previous review```\nOk the game is pretty good I like the direction it's headed and the real unix commands are somewhat close real world. Maybe not quite as diverse and\/or complex for better or worse but very nice. However there are some quality of life improvements and bug fixes I would love to see. \n\n1. SAVE POINTS! if you lose you have to start all over. \n2. There is almost no tutorial to speak of or clear mission to the game at the start like games like uplink, hacknet, and hackmud have. \n3. The game lags randomly and I have to alt tab in and out to make it work again. It just hangs up for no reason. \n4. The most annoying thing is that there is no copy or paste short cut on the key board to terminal. YES I know it's not cntrl c and v standard but in linux it's cntrl shift c and cntrl shift v. This would greatly help alot cause the auto fill isn't going to finish an ip address or mac for. \n5. When you log into someone else's mail you can't see your mail when you log back into your own account. \n6. There are alot of important files on logs in systems that are in Spanish despite the game being set to English. I can not read spanish and typing all that in a google translator to see what I'm missing is a pain. Please work on all that. Thanks, I really look forward to seen this game get

{"review":"I must say that I am impressed with this game so far and hyped for its potential. With emphasis on potential! Having played most other hacking games I can say that this game offers the most realistic hacking I have ever seen in the genre. Seeing how the developer seems determined to make this the ultimate hacking experience containing everything a hacking game could ever need \u2013 it looks very promising.\n\nPros:\nVery realistic hacking experience\nSandbox style multiplayer universe where everything you do has an impact on everyone else\nConstantly getting improved and updated\nThe developer is very involved with the community and shapes the game according to feedback\nCustomizable UI\nAbility to hack other players\nHardware customization with the basic PC parts\nThis game is going to have scripting in the future so players can make their own viruses and stuff\nPretty in depth website building with html\/css\/nitro(Similar to JS)\nUser created content\n\nCons:\nQuite a few alpha bugs\nLacks balancing which can be difficult at times\nHas many placeholder systems waiting to be replaced (it is not a finished product \u2013 being alpha ofc)\nOnly a few missions available that are quite similar\nNo story\n\nThis game has quality hacking tools and even more depth is being added. When all that comes together it has the capacity to become the best hacking sandbox game ever made\u2026\nThat being said, this game is in alpha, so it is not a smooth and polished experience. So, I think that if you are not ready to play the game in it\u2019s unfinished form, this is definitely one game keep an eye

{"review":"This is an early review after spending an hour in the game, which is in alpha.\n\nSo far, I've been able to progress a bit into the game, figuring out how to hack into a personal computer and get an e-mail account password.\n\nI will say this.  It's engaging, but a bit rough around the edges.  Your mouse pointer can disappear at times.  Shutdown and Reboot don't work yet.  Websites are very basic and repetitive.  The terminal functionality isn't as fleshed out as I would like, but it's a start.\n\nThe game is definitely playable, just needs some work.\n\nI didn't mind plopping down $10 for a game that shows real promise in its early stages.

{"review":"I've played a lot of hacking sims over the years, (Hacking Simulator 2016, Dark Signs Online, hack_me), and while this game is in a very rudimentary state, if it realizes into what it could be, this could be the game that sticks around.\n\nFirst Impressions + Gameplay here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TziTGPekzdc\n\n[h1]Gameplay[\/h1]\n\nAs far as most games in the genre go, Grey Hack is very technical. Focusing primarily on terminal gameplay, the game is a lot harder to start out in, because of the lack of graphic interfaces for a lot of the functions, which could possibly turn less technical players off. Still, with enough practice, it's easy to overcome these hurdles, which are likely temporary until the game is fully developed. The promise of procedurally generated missions is great, if it's done well. Already, I like the subtle variations in the actual missions, and that they don't really devolve into the same button clicks each time--a problem with a lot of the genre. It's also great that the game mimics real life Linux, using the same commands and file structures, and also has some of the same features that it does (placing commands in \/usr\/bin and \/bin will let you use them anywhere, and passwd is in \/etc, etc). There's a lot of placeholder spots in the game's features, but it's better to see implemented placeholders than it is to see bullet points on an intended features page. However, the game at its current state is still a little simple, but should flesh out over time.\n\n\n[h1]Graphics, etc[\/h1]\n\nGrey Hack isn't a visual-arts masterpiece, but it's also not ugly. The game doesn't have god rays or dynamic shadows, but then again it's a simulation of a computer, so I wouldn't expect it. It certainly looks and feels a lot better than much of the genre, actually mimmicking the aestetics of an actual operating system, as well as the functionality. The only draw back in the A\/V department is the silence. There isn't any sound or music in the game, which makes it a little awkard to play at times. It's not a major feature, but having something there would make it feel more complete.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[\/h1]\n\nOverall, Grey Hack is one of the better hacking games I've played in a while. It doesn't quite beat the genre in functionality just yet, but within the near future, it'll likely develop into something above the most. If you're not technically inclined, it's going to take some time to learn, but it's not impossible. If you're looking for a nearly-developed game, come back in a couple months. If you're looking for something to scratch your Hacking Sim itch, but willing to stick with the weirdness of initial development, I'd reccomend picking up this game.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":34,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.746873021125793457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":1084,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":742,"author_last_played":1579220413000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0394884403,"log_playtime_forever":6.989335266,"log_playtime_at_review":6.6106960447,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-0.2139599429,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.0546114331,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.684501845,"days_from_last_played_time":1461,"review_length":2699,"review_word_count":459,"engagement_score":35,"playtime_category":"Very

{"review":"Just finished the Tutorial and God Damn is this game good.\n\nThere seemed to be a few issues on Launch but the developer has Sorted them out and from my Experience the game runs perfectly. \n\n*This is a Proper Hacking Game, using actual Typing and Terminals, this might sound scary but once you've done things a few times you'll get the hang of it (I jumped in pretty much blind and all of this is new to me but after trial and error I got the system down)*\n\n--Gameplay--\nAs stated this is Pure hacking, Not Uplink with programs that do everything for you You have to do everything by typing and Boy is it fun and tense. Buy Programs and Do Jobs, that's currently all you can do (There is a sandbox element to the game so who knows what else there is to do currently, trailer shows traffic cams which looks cool!). Currently nothing you do effects other people but that is planned and I can't wait.\n\n--Multiplayer--\nLike I said you currently don't really have an effect on other people but that is planned and will add so much to this game.\n\n--Conclusion--\nIf you've been waiting for a Hacking game to play that features actual hacking then this is the game. The price may be a little too high for the current main content excluding sandboxy stuff but if you want to get in and get a feel for the game before more stuff is added I highly reccommend it. Currently a 7\/10, Lacks main content but has a stable array of things to do currently.\n\nI'll do a Video on the game soon and edit the review however I reccommend checking this guy's video out in the meantime as it's a good first impressions and is what I used to decide to purchase the

{"review":"I started off in Multiplayer mode first.\n\nThe interface is a bit weird to get used to but its not hard. You are given complete control at the very start of \"booting\" up your computer. From there you are shown a desktop with some files and generic items neatly stacked at the top.\n\nWhen reading the 'readme.txt' file you are told to do a certain task and thats it. Granted looking back im surprised how long it took me to figure it out but it was a time waster on trying to complete this \"tutorial\".\n\nOnce you installed some files you were again left to your devices to find and use the Help guide. It tells you how to use the codes you have access to which helps a lot. Sadly from this point i ran into two gamebreaking bugs. Both seems to be easy fixes so nothing to major but can really stop you from progressing.\n\nFirst the Help guide is actually wrong. The very first code you need to type in is wrong in the guide and you will fail everytime no matter what. I only figured this out by forgetting a part of the code that was shown.\n\nSecond: Your mouse will disappear at one point and then your severly handicapped since this is a very heavy window based game, meaning you need to open and close multiple window and highlight long strings of text. The only way I have currently found to fix this one was to simply restart the game.\n\nAs of right now this is a no for the current game state.

{"review":"Unless you know how to code, i can't recommend this game.\n\nThe game starts out pretty straight forward (after a bit of learning), you use tools from the shop, some things more difficult than others, but still do-able.\n\nAll of a sudden you'll reach a complete dead end. I got a mission to hack into a PC with no ports. No open ports, no closed ports, nothing. Everything up to this point is involving hacking into ports with tools from the shop, or using social engineering emails. Whether they're open ports or closed ports, you can figure it out using things explained either in the manual, in the shop descriptions, or things learned from Youtube tutorials.\n\nBut a PC with no ports? The game doesn't give you any clue how to tackle this. Nothing in the manual, no Youtube videos and nothing in the steam forum will help with this. It's a complete dead end with no information on how to move forward. I spent 10+ hours trying to tackle this and didn't make any progress whatsoever, spent hours watching Youtube videos, scoured the forum and web, tried every tool from the shop, and didn't progress even a tiny bit, still stuck exactly where i started, just wasted a bunch of time. Either you already know how to do this, or you can't complete it. The game leaves you dead in the water. It's not something that can be figured out through trial and error.\n\nPlus the game isn't massively popular, so there isn't a lot of information out there to help. If you're a complete beginner or a coding novice like myself. Good luck.\n\nUnless you already know how to code, forget it.","voted_up":0,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496637701988220215","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":1812,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":1728,"author_last_played":1672083257000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.0212643678,"log_playtime_forever":7.5027382108,"log_playtime_at_review":7.4552984857,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.0803825176,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.5864748604,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.9536423841,"days_from_last_played_time":386,"review_length":1571,"review_word_count":284,"engagement_score":22,"playtime_category":"Very

{"review":"First off I'm dyslexic and therefore a terrible writer. So I'm sorry if this is hard to follow.\n\n\nI can't recommend this game as of now. Even though I've played over 24 hours in total, I'm not sure I've enjoyed any of it. \n\nThere is no real in-game tutorial but there is a couple dozen YouTube videos, (I don't think any are 100% up to date, but that's not a huge deal), Discord, and a codedocs website for the programming language. \n\nAll-in-all I've probably spent close to 40ish hours outside of the game trying to learn how to play it, but I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere.\n\nAll of the missions that I've tried are doable (though some on Discord say they've run into an impossible one), but right now there are only 3-4 different missions so it gets repetitive quickly.\n\nI'm also fully aware that this is an Early Access game and that the developer is both aware of, and has plans to address the issues mentioned. \n\nIf you notice that my hours played has increased since this review, it's because I truly WANT to like this game.\n\n\n\n[Update]: Formatting & more insight after an additional 24 hours of playing since my original review.\n\n\n\nAfter playing another 24 hours here are some additional thoughts\u2026\n\nI think I can recommend this game to people who know how to code (software engineers \/ programmers), or who truly want to learn how. However, I still can\u2019t recommend this game to most people as it\u2019s missing a badly needed in-game tutorial. \n\n(Note: there technically is a tutorial of sorts in the game, but it\u2019s terrible.)\n\nI\u2019ve now probably spent close to 100 hours watching and re-watching every YouTube video I can find, read the Discord logs until my eyes hurt, use a custom Grey Script language pack for Notepad++ to practice my coding, and even printed out the codedocs, so I could mark it up like my college notes. Yet I still feel that I\u2019m missing some major things, even though I\u2019ve successfully made a few simple programs.\n\nI like what this game could (and probably will) be. I love puzzles and I\u2019m stubborn, so I hate the fact that I\u2019m not figuring some major things out, but I can\u2019t leave this game alone. So, I will continue to play.","voted_up":0,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":10,"weighted_vote_score":"0.619880735874176025","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":4222,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":1622,"author_last_played":1639024486000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.1193322981,"log_playtime_forever":8.3483010549,"log_playtime_at_review":7.3920315675,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.5651577816,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.5466343883,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.3841781146,"days_from_last_played_time":769,"review_length":2159,"review_word_count":388,"engagement_score":52,"playtime_category":"Very

{"review":"So seems I have to do  this to reach out to staff....\n     I like the game it is decent. However to reach out to support they recommend discord. But they set it to where you have to provide discord a phone number to talk on their discord. Which is not going to happen. There is no way in hell i will be giving discord my private info to reach out to you. I mean you can for me to link my steam and thats proof enough im not a bot. oh wait you added a Greymail Thats great to bad You have to be a member for x amount of time before you can suggest that its a bad idea to ask for a phone number.\n     Anyways since i couldnt get info on nightly threw the discord since im not allowed in i had to get info from google. Got the key and wasnt warned it would whipe all my progress... Thanks was going to make a suggestion that they make a tutorial on how to rename the base game file so it installs nightly in a new folder so you dont lose progress but seems they dont care to hear it. So noow im here having to leave negitive feedback in hopes that the staff look into removing the phone number requirment and adding the tutorial so others dont waste over 100 hours like i did because i was not able to see any warning.","voted_up":0,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.445369452238082886","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":13498,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":7470,"author_last_played":1682381650000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.1639646465,"log_playtime_forever":9.5103708876,"log_playtime_at_review":8.918784138,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":1.2313917744,"normalized_playtime_at_review":1.5080617006,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.5534153208,"days_from_last_played_time":267,"review_length":1215,"review_word_count":246,"engagement_score":8,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":-0.9041,"cleaned_review_tokens":["so","seems","i","have","to","do","this","to","reach","out","to","staff","i","like","the","game","it","is","decent","however","to","reach","out","to","support","they","recommend","discord","but","they","set","it","to","where","you","have","to","provide","discord","a","phone","number","to","talk","on","their","discord","which","is","not","going","to","happen","there","is","no","way","in","hell","i","will","be","giving","discord","my","private","info","to","reach","out","to","you","i","mean","you","can","for","me","to","link","my","steam","and","thats","proof","enough","im","not","a","bot","oh","wait","you","added","a","greymail","thats","great","to","bad","you","have","to","be","a","member","for","x","amount","of","time","before","you","can","suggest","that","its","a","bad","idea","to","ask","for","a","phone","number","anyways","since","i","couldnt","get","info","on","nightly","threw","the","discord","since","im","not","allowed","in","i","had","to","get","info","from","google","got","the","key","and","wasnt","warned","it","would","whipe","all","my","progress","thanks","was","going","to","make","a","suggestion","that","they","make","a","tutorial","on","how","to","rename","the","base","game","file","so","it","installs","nightly","in","a","new","folder","so","you","dont","lose","progress","but","seems","they","dont","care","to","hear","it","so","noow","im","here","having","to","leave","negitive","feedback","in","hopes","that","the","staff","look","into","removing","the","phone","number","requirment","and","adding","the","tutorial","so","others","dont","waste","over","hours","like","i","did","because","i","was","not","able","to","see","any","warning"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["seems","reach","staff","like","decent","however","reach","support","recommend","discord","set","provide","discord","phone","number","talk","discord","going","happen","way","hell","giving","discord","private","info","reach","mean","link","steam","thats","proof","enough","im","bot","oh","wait","added","greymail","thats","great","bad","member","x","amount","time","suggest","bad","idea","ask","phone","number","anyways","since","couldnt","get","info","nightly","threw","discord","since","im","allowed","get","info","google","got","key","wasnt","warned","would","whipe","progress","thanks","going","make","suggestion","make","tutorial","rename","base","file","installs","nightly","new","folder","dont","lose","progress","seems","dont","care","hear","noow","im","leave","negitive","feedback","hopes","staff","look","removing","phone","number","requirment","adding","tutorial","others","dont","waste","hours","like","able","see","warning"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"seems reach staff like decent however reach support recommend discord set provide discord phone number talk discord going happen way hell giving discord private info reach mean link steam thats proof enough im bot oh wait added greymail thats great bad member x amount time suggest bad idea ask phone number anyways since couldnt get info nightly threw discord since im allowed get info google got key wasnt warned would whipe progress thanks going make suggestion make tutorial rename base file installs nightly new folder dont lose progress seems dont care hear noow im leave negitive feedback hopes staff look removing phone number requirment adding tutorial others dont waste hours like able see warning","retention_score":-0.0477410947,"retention_score_scaled":0.2654729565}
{"review":"Update 10\/7\/23\nI Just wanted to update my review : I figured i'd give it a shot again after a long time to see if any changes were made or if something became alittle easier for the \"new guy\" But as suspected, all is crap.\n\nOnce again we run into a new guy doing small missions which are simple. of course as you gain rep you'd assume things get harder...maybe they do but as just gaining a 1 rep (very low rep) and running into missions that require you to fetch a file off a computer sure turns into a mess.\n\nSo as a new guy, running into a computer with \"No Ports\" aswell as trying to figure out how to get thru the LAN system to this computer that has nothing to connect to or finding a way to get into a Router.....once again...we hit the web, the complaints, the how-to's, the google searches of scripts and whatever you can find basically.\n\nIn your searches your gonna see people throw bones on how to gain access to something with no ports (which don't work) and some will tell you to just end the mission or move on. Though I did try that method and got a new mission with the same scenario. (Funny how that works out.) among your searches you'll see some videos that explain nothing really, long winded, and maybe run into some scripts in github (which don't work worth a shit) - You'll hear of some methods where you gotta throw in a shell sniffer and make \"funny emails\" and so on and so on and so on etc etc......in the end the dev will explain they are puzzles and go make your own scripts. (Really...?..We just started the game..)\n\nI racked some hours into this game. I believe I spent only about 1-2 hrs of hacking succesfully - the rest is me searching the web for answers and how-to's and gained nothing while logged into the game. Thing is, shouldn't be this crazy or is it bugs? Dev needs to create more loopholes and better script availability in the markets due to half the scripts available don't really do much that you'd want.\n\nMaking someone at a rep 0 \/ Rep 1 having to start throwing lib files, and exe's, and bin files, and whatever you have in an arsenal for grabbing a file and have to get thru a LAN\/Router\/Hub\/Switches : Killing firewalls : trying to access a computer with \"No ports\" : research social engineering : Read thru all your complaints and discussions, using chinese button mashing skills on google to find info is just nuts. Your trying to take a newbie to your game, and throw him\/her into a uber-advanced-script guru-l33t hax0r-Zer0Cool-DaVinci engineer type player in an hour or less. So...Design more loops, more options, more user-friendly approach. \n \nIt use to be slightly better in the script market, but the dev removed scripts because it was \"Unfair\" - how does this even make sense when you want folks to design scripts to play this game and then just remove the good ones that do work. Do we really have to go dig in google to obtain methods in your game?

{"review":"Game is currently in a very rough state, can't recommend it.\n\nMy primary complaint is that this game doesn't seem to know what it's trying to be. It's either trying to be a puzzle game or a simulation game, and it really doesn't do a good job of either. \n\nIf its a puzzle game, then the game needs to do a better job of teaching the elements of the puzzles it expects you to solve, also needs to never have \"unsolvable\" puzzles like it does now. Someone defending the game might then say \"no no, its not a puzzle game, its a SIM game.\" Okay, then it needs to have MUCH better in-game documentation (actual man pages are a bare minimum here), it needs to acknowledge that sometimes a job cannot be completed with your current set of tools and you need to cover those edge-cases mechanically, and the game world needs to at least kinda resemble reality (currently every website in-game is \"under construction\" and provides zero information, no one is on a computer unless they're social engineered to do so even during work hours, and so on).\n\nBasically the game is very far from being complete. There's a lot that the game does right, even if its a bit buggy. Its a pretty good emulation of a desktop environment, terminal commands usually do what you'd expect them to, and the user generated content seems pretty neat.

{"review":"Steam has a great multitude of hacking games. I was drawn to this one because, visually and thematically, it's very similar to [url=https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1510\/]Uplink[\/url] but is under active development and offers multiplayer.\n\nUnlike [url=https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/469920\/]Hackmud[\/url], the plot -- such that it is -- actually makes sense, the hacking is relatively free-form and realistic, and the multiplayer actually works and works well. Unlike the [url=https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/sub\/17602\/]Hacker Evolution series[\/url], you aren't on rails and handcuffed to the plot. [url=https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/bundle\/3028\/]Hacknet[\/url] comes close, but this game offers a limited form of scripting and much more dynamism.\n\nHere's where I get stuck:\n[list]\n[*]There's a lot of yak shaving involved in hacking (just like in real life): you have to do intelligence gathering about your target, you have to scan your target for open ports, you have to trigger a vuln to get yourself a shell, you have to map the network, you may have to repeat all that several times in order to pivot around the network, and [i]then[\/i] you actually carry out the mission.\n[*]The in-game scripting engine isn't a typical one like Lua or Python or JavaScript. It's its own thing. Which isn't necessarily bad, but it does mean you do have to learn it separately -- or not; you can completely ignore it if you're willing to spend in-game pocket change on pre-built exploits, and the game specifically tells you that when you try to use it.\n[*]The in-game scripting engine isn't powerful enough to hide the yak shaving. While subroutines are supported, include files are not. Many in-game commands have been rewritten to use the scripting engine, but you can't reflect on them or call into their members -- you can only run them and have human eyeballs glance at the terminal output. Some tasks just aren't available to the scripting engine -- want to iterate through the hosts on a LAN, looking for one with the service you want to break into? Sorry, you have to use the LAN visualizer and hand-type IPs. And although the exploits available to you optionally come with source code, there isn't a straightforward way for you to automatically pull that source code into a larger toolkit -- there's [i]some[\/i] file and string manipulation code available to you, but I didn't see a way programmatically to turn a \"pop a shell in the terminal window\" tool into a \"provide a shell object to a higher-level tool\" subroutine.\n[*]The game has a variety of vulnerabilities you can discover or purchase, offering different approaches with different limitations and a lot of flavor. Generally speaking, only one matters: \"Pop a normal user shell. Remote use. No requirements.\" While the other actions -- sniff banking credentials or the password file or change a random password or get a list of other installed libraries -- can be useful in some situations, a non-guest shell can do all of that, and if you really need root for anything you can grab the password file and sudo to root. The only requirement that is met with any frequency is minimum number of registered users, but it's rare enough that exploits that need it aren't going to be a part of your toolbelt. If you have a remote exploit that gets you guest access, and you can pair it with a local exploit that gets you the access you need, that also works, but those typically won't be in your toolbelt either so that adds further to your workload.\n[*]There are consistency issues. You can access any bank account using any bank. Domain names used for e-mail are separate from domain names used for browsing, which are separate from domain names listed in whois, and none of these exactly align with the domain names available to nslookup. Running programs and browsing the web from your victims' computers use your saved passwords, favorites, and history. All banks' sites look exactly alike, as do all shops, all hack shops, and all e-mail service providers.\n[*]There are a lot of little UI polish issues, like the equivalent of Trace Tracker taking up a full-size window with no aural or visual cues, copying and pasting not always working, no one-click mission summary (though you can use the Email program) or sticky notes (though you can use the Notepad program), every site's homepage is at a slightly different zoom level than all the content pages, every remote window using a single color for its title bar, etc. This can all be fixed, but I don't feel confident the developer will have enough time to finish fleshing out the core gameplay loop, continue to add major new features like the recent LAN update, maintain multiplayer services and a reasonable community, [i]and[\/i] handle little UI issues like these by their currently-planned Q3 2021 release date.\n[*]There's no mod support, even for single player, and it looks like it'll be tricky to wedge it in from the outside. For me to expect it in a multiplayer game at alpha level like this is borderline insane, but I could probably fix every issue I've mentioned in this review if the scripting engine were structured a little differently and I could get my foot in the door.\n[\/list]\n\nWhile I'm hopeful this will eventually end up being a better Uplink than Uplink itself, it definitely isn't quite there yet, and I don't see there being enough time and direction left to bring it to the point where I'd enjoy getting lost in it.","voted_up":0,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591555655002593994","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":157,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":157,"author_last_played":1604876088000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0117211657,"log_playtime_forever":5.062595033,"log_playtime_at_review":5.062595033,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-1.318592214,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-0.9202594291,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":1.0,"days_from_last_played_time":1164,"review_length":5458,"review_word_count":908,"engagement_score":17,"playtime_category":"Medium","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9825,"cleaned_review_tokens":["steam","has","a","great","multitude","of","hacking","games","i","was","drawn","to","this","one","because","visually","and","thematically","its","very","similar","to","urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomappuplinkurl","but","is","under","active","development","and","offers","multiplayer","unlike","urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapphackmudurl","the","plot","such","that","it","is","actually","makes","sense","the","hacking","is","relatively","freeform","and","realistic","and","the","multiplayer","actually","works","and","works","well","unlike","the","urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomsubhacker","evolution","seriesurl","you","arent","on","rails","and","handcuffed","to","the","plot","urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcombundlehackneturl","comes","close","but","this","game","offers","a","limited","form","of","scripting","and","much","more","dynamism","heres","where","i","get","stuck","list","theres","a","lot","of","yak","shaving","involved","in","hacking","just","like","in","real","life","you","have","to","do","intelligence","gathering","about","your","target","you","have","to","scan","your","target","for","open","ports","you","have","to","trigger","a","vuln","to","get","yourself","a","shell","you","have","to","map","the","network","you","may","have","to","repeat","all","that","several","times","in","order","to","pivot","around","the","network","and","itheni","you","actually","carry","out","the","mission","the","ingame","scripting","engine","isnt","a","typical","one","like","lua","or","python","or","javascript","its","its","own","thing","which","isnt","necessarily","bad","but","it","does","mean","you","do","have","to","learn","it","separately","or","not","you","can","completely","ignore","it","if","youre","willing","to","spend","ingame","pocket","change","on","prebuilt","exploits","and","the","game","specifically","tells","you","that","when","you","try","to","use","it","the","ingame","scripting","engine","isnt","powerful","enough","to","hide","the","yak","shaving","while","subroutines","are","supported","include","files","are","not","many","ingame","commands","have","been","rewritten","to","use","the","scripting","engine","but","you","cant","reflect","on","them","or","call","into","their","members","you","can","only","run","them","and","have","human","eyeballs","glance","at","the","terminal","output","some","tasks","just","arent","available","to","the","scripting","engine","want","to","iterate","through","the","hosts","on","a","lan","looking","for","one","with","the","service","you","want","to","break","into","sorry","you","have","to","use","the","lan","visualizer","and","handtype","ips","and","although","the","exploits","available","to","you","optionally","come","with","source","code","there","isnt","a","straightforward","way","for","you","to","automatically","pull","that","source","code","into","a","larger","toolkit","theres","isomei","file","and","string","manipulation","code","available","to","you","but","i","didnt","see","a","way","programmatically","to","turn","a","pop","a","shell","in","the","terminal","window","tool","into","a","provide","a","shell","object","to","a","higherlevel","tool","subroutine","the","game","has","a","variety","of","vulnerabilities","you","can","discover","or","purchase","offering","different","approaches","with","different","limitations","and","a","lot","of","flavor","generally","speaking","only","one","matters","pop","a","normal","user","shell","remote","use","no","requirements","while","the","other","actions","sniff","banking","credentials","or","the","password","file","or","change","a","random","password","or","get","a","list","of","other","installed","libraries","can","be","useful","in","some","situations","a","nonguest","shell","can","do","all","of","that","and","if","you","really","need","root","for","anything","you","can","grab","the","password","file","and","sudo","to","root","the","only","requirement","that","is","met","with","any","frequency","is","minimum","number","of","registered","users","but","its","rare","enough","that","exploits","that","need","it","arent","going","to","be","a","part","of","your","toolbelt","if","you","have","a","remote","exploit","that","gets","you","guest","access","and","you","can","pair","

Grey Hack's flow is \"Alright, so I'm gonna check the firmware and download the exploit for the version I see. Check, now time to test it. Oh, it doesn't work. Guess I'll grab a different contract. *Repeat Process.* Oh hey, it worked this time. However, the passwords it deciphered don;t work. Well, let's move on to the next contract.\" There's no flow, no content. No balance, no gameplay. It's a mess of \"hacking\" that's really just \"Hey, do you know our programming language?

{"review":"You got to ask yourself a two questions.\n\nFirst:\nDo I like coding, and writing my own scripts?\n\nIf yes, then you have to ask yourself the second question:\nDo I like being forced or directed towards said coding and writing my own scripts, right after a walk in the park tutorial?\n\nSo yeah as much as i'd like to recommend this game to anyone, I really cannot.\nFirst you get a simple tutorial that sets the premise, and it is really quite easy to do.\nAnd then you get your first mission, and oh boy does it turn into a s***show from there.\n\nLet me elaborate. Since the game is rng in it's nature, you get random ports on the target computer.\nWhat that means is, you can get missions with no possible way of entering into, with the tools provided in the shop, or hackshop.\n\nSo what do you do? Right, you go to community for help. Problem is, the community will most likely tell you very vaguely, to go and learn coding and ingame scripting.\n\nIt does not matter that this is the first mission you get, it does not matter you would much rather learn coding rather organically, while progressing through the game, and later start doing it yourself, just to make things easier on yourself.\nNo, go learn how to write your own hacks, or you won't be able to do anything in this game.\n\nTo clarify i did finish one out of 10 i tried, just by luck now that i think about it.\n\nWas close second time by even getting username and password to log into the computer, BUT the target didn't had ports needed to actually log in. Yep you guessed it. GO LEARN INGAME CODING.\n\nSo yeah, untill this gets fixed and it actually let's me play normally, and reserve the coding for either high level missions, or just to make thing easier out of laziness, I'm done with this game.\n\nOh and one more thing, Forget about any tutorials, since every patch the game seems to change things drastically, and throw away bunch of tools available, so almost all tutorials are out of date, and impossible to follow.\n\nIn summary: Go play Uplink, or hacknet if you don't want to be forced to learn the ingame coding language to write your own hacks that actually work.","voted_up":0,"votes_up":40,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605942428112030029","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":1720,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":1690,"author_last_played":1626159899000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0743743079,"log_playtime_forever":7.4506607962,"log_playtime_at_review":7.4330753489,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.0505256684,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.5724804967,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.9825581395,"days_from_last_played_time":918,"review_length":2125,"review_word_count":396,"engagement_score":53,"playtime_category":"Very

{"review":"I really want to enjoy this game, and give it an upvote. But it's really only playable for people that are already knowledgeable about hacking. For the uninitiated, the game just doesn't have adequate tutorials. And it leaves you on your own to try and hack into police centers, and multiple devices. And you just won't know what you're doing. \n\nThe community tries to flesh out some guides, but they are also just not really enough. I've tried multiple missions, following the advice of guides and other users, and when their information fails, there's just no where you can go. You can try and break it at times, but then get traced. \n\nUplink and Hacknet do a much better job of introducing new players to this genre. While remaining challenging at the same time. \n\nUnfortunately, unless the devs add an extended tutorial that will guide you, not only through the first steps, but through multiple missions and different scenarios, there's nothing I can recommend about the game. \n\nThere's some cool features here. It's satisfying when things do work. But 9 times outta 10, nothing works. \n\nAnd I only see experienced coders enjoying the game.","voted_up":0,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":798,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":199,"author_last_played":1602872969000,"textblob_sentiment":0.0748232323,"log_playtime_forever":6.6833609458,"log_playtime_at_review":5.2983173665,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-0.3893801175,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-0.7718202557,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":0.2493734336,"days_from_last_played_time":1187,"review_length":1145,"review_word_count":194,"engagement_score":1,"playtime_category":"High","reviewer_experience":"Veteran","vader_sentiment":0.7625,"cleaned_review_tokens":["i","really","want","to","enjoy","this","game","and","give","it","an","upvote","but","its","really","only","playable","for","people","that","are","already","knowledgeable","about","hacking","for","the","uninitiated","the","game","just","doesnt","have","adequate","tutorials","and","it","leaves","you","on","your","own","to","try","and","hack","into","police","centers","and","multiple","devices","and","you","just","wont","know","what","youre","doing","the","community","tries","to","flesh","out","some","guides","but","they","are","also","just","not","really","enough","ive","tried","multiple","missions","following","the","advice","of","guides","and","other","users","and","when","their","information","fails","theres","just","no","where","you","can","go","you","can","try","and","break","it","at","times","but","then","get","traced","uplink","and","hacknet","do","a","much","better","job","of","introducing","new","players","to","this","genre","while","remaining","challenging","at","the","same","time","unfortunately","unless","the","devs","add","an","extended","tutorial","that","will","guide","you","not","only","through","the","first","steps","but","through","multiple","missions","and","different","scenarios","theres","nothing","i","can","recommend","about","the","game","theres","some","cool","features","here","its","satisfying","when","things","do","work","but","times","outta","nothing","works","and","i","only","see","experienced","coders","enjoying","the","game"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["really","want","enjoy","give","upvote","really","playable","people","already","knowledgeable","hacking","uninitiated","doesnt","adequate","tutorials","leaves","try","hack","police","centers","multiple","devices","wont","know","youre","community","tries","flesh","guides","also","really","enough","ive","tried","multiple","missions","following","advice","guides","users","information","fails","theres","go","try","break","times","get","traced","uplink","hacknet","much","better","job","introducing","new","players","genre","remaining","challenging","time","unfortunately","unless","devs","add","extended","tutorial","guide","first","steps","multiple","missions","different","scenarios","theres","nothing","recommend","theres","cool","features","satisfying","things","work","times","outta","nothing","works","see","experienced","coders","enjoying"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"really want enjoy give upvote really playable people already knowledgeable hacking uninitiated doesnt adequate tutorials leaves try hack police centers multiple devices wont know youre community tries flesh guides also really enough ive tried multiple missions following advice guides users information fails theres go try break times get traced uplink hacknet much better job introducing new players genre remaining challenging time unfortunately unless devs add extended tutorial guide first steps multiple missions different scenarios theres nothing recommend theres cool features satisfying things work times outta nothing works see experienced coders enjoying","retention_score":0.0388264311,"retention_score_scaled":0.3261768328}

{"review":"This sandbox environment game has great potential, but is hampered by an incredibly steep learning curve that requires lots of reading, a broken jobs system, and little to no information in necessary places.\n\nYou can accept jobs to hack certain targets (the only information that you know before you accept a mission is what type of hack it is). Some jobs require social engineering hacks, and some require you to scan the target's ports, looking for vulnerabilities, then running programs to exploit them.\n\nThe problem is that for about half of all jobs, there is not enough information to complete the job. For instance, in one job type you hack into various schools and change the grades of students. You can run a \"whois\" command to see who the admin is, but in order to perform a social engineering hack, you also need the name of an employee of the school (so you can send the admin an email posing as the employee), but it may be impossible to get the name of another employee. \n\nYou could have a library full of programs designed to hack the port vulnerabilities, but if you don't have a program designed for the specific version number of the target system's vulnerability, then you can't do it. You also have no way of searching for a program that will work on that specific version, and you can't even filter the programs by vulnerability type! So you have to spend 30 minutes scrolling through a gigantic list of all available programs, clicking on each one and reading the description to find one that may be applicable (and because of current bugs in the job system, NO APPLICABLE PROGRAM MAY EXIST meaning all of that time searching was wasted, and you have to abandon the job anyways).\n\nThese things create an insane gameplay loop that involves taking tons of notes in a separate notepad, spending tons of time reading documentation for all of the available commands, and frequently finding jobs that are either impossible to complete, or are so tedious to complete that you would rather abandon them immediately and blindly accept other jobs in hopes that they may take less time to finish.\n\nI will update this review if these problems are ever resolved.\n\nTL;DR This game has an incredibly steep learning curve because of all of the reading required, the jobs system is broken (with jobs that are impossible to complete, or

{"review":"While a fun and interesting experience, greyhack lacked in user friendliness. The tutorial department, while there, gives very few hints and leave you withought much help, as the manual is also extremly hard to follow past basic instructions. Overall if you get the hang of it its a fun 8\/10 but due to its difficulty getting into I have to rate it a 5\/10. While most difficult games give clear instructions and rely on the skill of the player to advance this is stopped by the nature of a hacking sim based on drawing conclusions based on limited information. If you like a challenging experience then go for it but be prepared to be thrown naked into the woods, with a good wolf infestation.

{"review":"Getting a refund. \n3\/10\nGame is generic, ugly and unexciting.\nUnfinished and very buggy and confusing.\nI dont know if early access can save it.\nEDIT: Like 6 months after even though I've refunded the game after the review I still stand by my point, it was wrong of me to expect a finished game and for there to be not be bugs. The game UI is fairly ew and definitely Grey. Much uglier than hacknet much more realistic than hacknet. Brings me to my second point, the realism. There isn't really much point to the game and is hyper realistic. It's like installing kali but uglier and with a story that doesn't make much sense and it doesnt really seem to captivate me at all and to add onto this with the amount of realism it gets things wrong so weirdly enough if you know eg how to use aircrack then you get confused with the fact that it skips and changes commands. I am interested in multiplayer aspects and things such as running your own website could be exciting but the fact that it's not focused on multiplayer has me worried and the option to skip the tutorial doesn't exist at all.","voted_up":0,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.269979029893875122","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":82,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"author_playtime_at_review":82,"author_last_played":1522173292000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.0238095238,"log_playtime_forever":4.4188406078,"log_playtime_at_review":4.4188406078,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.0,"normalized_playtime_forever":-1.6876673496,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-1.3256447539,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":-0.4073518915,"playtime_ratio":1.0,"days_from_last_played_time":2121,"review_length":1090,"review_word_count":204,"engagement_score":12,"playtime_category":"Low","reviewer_experience":"Veteran","vader_sentiment":-0.9225,"cleaned_review_tokens":["getting","a","refund","game","is","generic","ugly","and","unexciting","unfinished","and","very","buggy","and","confusing","i","dont","know","if","early","access","can","save","it","edit","like","months","after","even","though","ive","refunded","the","game","after","the","review","i","still","stand","by","my","point","it","was","wrong","of","me","to","expect","a","finished","game","and","for","there","to","be","not","be","bugs","the","game","ui","is","fairly","ew","and","definitely","grey","much","uglier","than","hacknet","much","more","realistic","than","hacknet","brings","me","to","my","second","point","the","realism","there","isnt","really","much","point","to","the","game","and","is","hyper","realistic","its","like","installing","kali","but","uglier","and","with","a","story","that","doesnt","make","much","sense","and","it","doesnt","really","seem","to","captivate","me","at","all","and","to","add","onto","this","with","the","amount","of","realism","it","gets","things","wrong","so","weirdly","enough","if","you","know","eg","how","to","use","aircrack","then","you","get","confused","with","the","fact","that","it","skips","and","changes","commands","i","am","interested","in","multiplayer","aspects","and","things","such","as","running","your","own","website","could","be","exciting","but","the","fact","that","its","not","focused","on","multiplayer","has","me","worried","and","the","option","to","skip","the","tutorial","doesnt","exist","at","all"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["getting","refund","generic","ugly","unexciting","unfinished","buggy","confusing","dont","know","early","access","save","edit","like","months","even","though","ive","refunded","review","still","stand","point","wrong","expect","finished","bugs","ui","fairly","ew","definitely","grey","much","uglier","hacknet","much","realistic","hacknet","brings","second","point","realism","isnt","really","much","point","hyper","realistic","like","installing","kali","uglier","story","doesnt","make","much","sense","doesnt","really","seem","captivate","add","onto","amount","realism","gets","things","wrong","weirdly","enough","know","eg","use","aircrack","get","confused","fact","skips","changes","commands","interested","multiplayer","aspects","things","running","website","could","exciting","fact","focused","multiplayer","worried","option","skip","tutorial","doesnt","exist"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"getting refund generic ugly unexciting unfinished buggy confusing dont know early access save edit like months even though ive refunded review still stand point wrong expect finished bugs ui fairly ew definitely grey much uglier hacknet much realistic hacknet brings second point realism isnt really much point hyper realistic like installing kali uglier story doesnt make much sense doesnt really seem captivate add onto amount realism gets things wrong weirdly enough know eg use aircrack get confused fact skips changes commands interested multiplayer aspects things running website could exciting fact focused multiplayer worried option skip tutorial doesnt exist","retention_score":-0.3684122336,"retention_score_scaled":0.0406082511}

{"review":"This is an awesome game for developers or at least power users that are familiar with light scripting work.  It can work for novices as well, but you have to understand that the nature of this game expects a certain level of familiarity with scripting and hacking concepts.  Anyone can do it, it will just take some people longer than others to catch on to some of the concepts.  It's not a bad introduction to using the command prompt in linux for those that need it.\n\nMy favorite thing about this game is that it baby steps you into the first couple of things, and what's really cool is that the game provides tools that are useful... BUT to really enjoy the game, you will want to write your own tools inside of the game to make hacking easier for yourself!\n\nIt is early access still (January 2024), and there are a few bugs, but that kind of lends some authenticity to what you're trying to do.  Buggy\/quirky things happen when you run software exploits, but sometimes a thing that should work doesn't, and when that happens it's a little frustrating.\n\nIf you're a Comp Sci major, you will probably be right at home with this if you understand command prompts and software concepts.  I look forward to seeing how much more polished it gets!","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":10690,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":8100,"author_playtime_at_review":10483,"author_last_played":1705373268000,"textblob_sentiment":0.1086538462,"log_playtime_forever":9.277157545,"log_playtime_at_review":9.2576055644,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":8.9997427898,"normalized_playtime_forever":1.0976866802,"normalized_playtime_at_review":1.7214244809,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":3.3819219428,"playtime_ratio":0.9806361085,"days_from_last_played_time":1,"review_length":1244,"review_word_count":225,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Newbie","vader_sentiment":0.9677,"cleaned_review_tokens":["this","is","an","awesome","game","for","developers","or","at","least","power","users","that","are","familiar","with","light","scripting","work","it","can","work","for","novices","as","well","but","you","have","to","understand","that","the","nature","of","this","game","expects","a","certain","level","of","familiarity","with","scripting","and","hacking","concepts","anyone","can","do","it","it","will","just","take","some","people","longer","than","others","to","catch","on","to","some","of","the","concepts","its","not","a","bad","introduction","to","using","the","command","prompt","in","linux","for","those","that","need","it","my","favorite","thing","about","this","game","is","that","it","baby","steps","you","into","the","first","couple","of","things","and","whats","really","cool","is","that","the","game","provides","tools","that","are","useful","but","to","really","enjoy","the","game","you","will","want","to","write","your","own","tools","inside","of","the","game","to","make","hacking","easier","for","yourself","it","is","early","access","still","january","and","there","are","a","few","bugs","but","that","kind","of","lends","some","authenticity","to","what","youre","trying","to","do","buggyquirky","things","happen","when","you","run","software","exploits","but","sometimes","a","thing","that","should","work","doesnt","and","when","that","happens","its","a","little","frustrating","if","youre","a","comp","sci","major","you","will","probably","be","right","at","home","with","this","if","you","understand","command","prompts","and","software","concepts","i","look","forward","to","seeing","how","much","more","polished","it","gets"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["awesome","developers","least","power","users","familiar","light","scripting","work","work","novices","well","understand","nature","expects","certain","level","familiarity","scripting","hacking","concepts","anyone","take","people","longer","others","catch","concepts","bad","introduction","using","command","prompt","linux","need","favorite","thing","baby","steps","first","couple","things","whats","really","cool","provides","tools","useful","really","enjoy","want","write","tools","inside","make","hacking","easier","early","access","still","january","bugs","kind","lends","authenticity","youre","trying","buggyquirky","things","happen","run","software","exploits","sometimes","thing","work","doesnt","happens","little","frustrating","youre","comp","sci","major","probably","right","home","understand","command","prompts","software","concepts","look","forward","seeing","much","polished","gets"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"awesome developers least power users familiar light scripting work work novices well understand nature expects certain level familiarity scripting hacking concepts anyone take people longer others catch concepts bad introduction using command prompt linux need favorite thing baby steps first couple things whats really cool provides tools useful really enjoy want write tools inside make hacking easier early access still january bugs kind lends authenticity youre trying buggyquirky things happen run software exploits sometimes thing work doesnt happens little frustrating youre comp sci major probably right home understand command prompts software concepts look forward seeing much polished gets","retention_score":0.8046977585,"retention_score_scaled":0.8632299362}

If you want to spend the time to learn how the game works, scripting your own exploits is a lot of fun. I'd stay off singleplayer besides to learn the basics and go straight into the multiplayer if you want to have a more immersive experience. Plus, the community is awesome. Not many people who are dicks also know what they're doing so it's a win win:)","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":6630,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":6630,"author_playtime_at_review":6247,"author_last_played":1705362218000,"textblob_sentiment":0.1854166667,"log_playtime_forever":8.7995109014,"log_playtime_at_review":8.7400166915,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":8.7995109014,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.8238439028,"normalized_playtime_at_review":1.3954881841,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":3.2976158161,"playtime_ratio":0.9422322775,"days_from_last_played_time":1,"review_length":491,"review_word_count":92,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Experienced","vader_sentiment":0.9114,"cleaned_review_tokens":["closest","to","realistic","hacking","ive","found","in","a","video","game","not","nearly","a","complete","game","and","obviously","simplified","as","it","is","just","a","video","game","if","you","want","to","spend","the","time","to","learn","how","the","game","works","scripting","your","own","exploits","is","a","lot","of","fun","id","stay","off","singleplayer","besides","to","learn","the","basics","and","go","straight","into","the","multiplayer","if","you","want","to","have","a","more","immersive","experience","plus","the","community","is","awesome","not","many","people","who","are","dicks","also","know","what","theyre","doing","so","its","a","win","win"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["closest","realistic","hacking","ive","found","video","nearly","complete","obviously","simplified","video","want","spend","time","learn","works","scripting","exploits","lot","fun","id","stay","singleplayer","besides","learn","basics","go","straight","multiplayer","want","immersive","experience","plus","community","awesome","many","people","dicks","also","know","theyre","win","win"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"closest realistic hacking ive found video nearly complete obviously simplified video want spend time learn works scripting exploits lot fun id stay singleplayer besides learn basics go straight multiplayer want immersive experience plus community awesome many people dicks also know theyre win win","retention_score":0.7683707744,"retention_score_scaled":0.8377563105}
{"review":"A lot of missing features that should be in a game about navigating a linux environment. Man pages are incomplete and a lot of flags are unavailable. Also the order of flags for some weird reason matters. \"ls -la\" work but \"ls -al\" apparently isn't a command. Some commands are way too dumbed down or blatantly wrong. SSH should be \"ssh username@hostname\" not \"ssh username@password hostname\". How do you not have vim? Why can't I use the \"-p\" flag with mkdir. Not being able to snap terminal windows to half the screen, have keyboard shortcuts, or second monitor  is the straw that broke the camels back for a game that is a linear slog at best and a tedious inaccurate poor attempt at a hacking game.\n\ntldr: If you don't have experience working in a unix environment, the game will be simultaneously boring and difficult. If you do, the game misses the mark on some basic quality of life features that any hacker, dev, sysadmin, etc would want. Just play some hack the box or something.","voted_up":0,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.400694876909255981","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":179,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":25,"author_playtime_at_review":179,"author_last_played":1705175772000,"textblob_sentiment":-0.2186111111,"log_playtime_forever":5.1929568509,"log_playtime_at_review":5.1929568509,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":3.258096538,"normalized_playtime_forever":-1.2438536123,"normalized_playtime_at_review":-0.8381679268,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":0.9644450864,"playtime_ratio":1.0,"days_from_last_played_time":3,"review_length":988,"review_word_count":176,"engagement_score":1,"playtime_category":"Medium","reviewer_experience":"Veteran","vader_sentiment":-0.9349,"cleaned_review_tokens":["a","lot","of","missing","features","that","should","be","in","a","game","about","navigating","a","linux","environment","man","pages","are","incomplete","and","a","lot","of","flags","are","unavailable","also","the","order","of","flags","for","some","weird","reason","matters","ls","la","work","but","ls","al","apparently","isnt","a","command","some","commands","are","way","too","dumbed","down","or","blatantly","wrong","ssh","should","be","ssh","usernamehostname","not","ssh","usernamepassword","hostname","how","do","you","not","have","vim","why","cant","i","use","the","p","flag","with","mkdir","not","being","able","to","snap","terminal","windows","to","half","the","screen","have","keyboard","shortcuts","or","second","monitor","is","the","straw","that","broke","the","camels","back","for","a","game","that","is","a","linear","slog","at","best","and","a","tedious","inaccurate","poor","attempt","at","a","hacking","game","tldr","if","you","dont","have","experience","working","in","a","unix","environment","the","game","will","be","simultaneously","boring","and","difficult","if","you","do","the","game","misses","the","mark","on","some","basic","quality","of","life","features","that","any","hacker","dev","sysadmin","etc","would","want","just","play","some","hack","the","box","or","something"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["lot","missing","features","navigating","linux","environment","man","pages","incomplete","lot","flags","unavailable","also","order","flags","weird","reason","matters","ls","la","work","ls","al","apparently","isnt","command","commands","way","dumbed","blatantly","wrong","ssh","ssh","usernamehostname","ssh","usernamepassword","hostname","vim","cant","use","p","flag","mkdir","able","snap","terminal","windows","half","screen","keyboard","shortcuts","second","monitor","straw","broke","camels","back","linear","slog","best","tedious","inaccurate","poor","attempt","hacking","tldr","dont","experience","working","unix","environment","simultaneously","boring","difficult","misses","mark","basic","quality","life","features","hacker","dev","sysadmin","etc","would","want","play","hack","box","something"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"lot missing features navigating linux environment man pages incomplete lot flags unavailable also order flags weird reason matters ls la work ls al apparently isnt command commands way dumbed blatantly wrong ssh ssh usernamehostname ssh usernamepassword hostname vim cant use p flag mkdir able snap terminal windows half screen keyboard shortcuts second monitor straw broke camels back linear slog best tedious inaccurate poor attempt hacking tldr dont experience working unix environment simultaneously boring difficult misses mark basic quality life features hacker dev sysadmin etc would want play hack box something","retention_score":-0.1007105074,"retention_score_scaled":0.2283291355}

{"review":"This was fun to learn for the first 5 hours. After the first 5 hours in singleplayer, you start to encounter level\/tier \"2\" missions. These tier 2 missions are literally impossible to complete with the standard toolset. Hours upon hours of \"No ports found\" and the hackshop having 4 unusable exploits, causing you to just skip missions perpetually, unless you want to just do tier 1 and 0 missions forever. \n\nThe only way around this is to go multiplayer, which is way further above your head than tier 2 missions, and use entirely player made scripts. So, basically, the game is already beaten for you by people who have scripted automatic hacks for every device, and the learning part of the game is gone completely. There may be something cool behind the \"hide things on different npc computers\" and stay hidden from players, but if you can't give the players the tools to complete missions in the base game, it's a thumbs down from me. I shouldn't have to go searching for player-made ultra custom scripts that beat the game for me, to complete a mission for $600.\n\nThere is no tutorial. There is very few examples. The examples given skip 90% of the setup process for certain things, like shell systems needing hacked emails. There is nowhere to see a list of options for completion of a mission. The best advice I have seen is \"if there are no ports open, just skip the mission\" when 99% of tier 2 missions have no open ports on every machine, unless of course you download super player scripts before being able to figure anything out on your own. \n\nOverall, I would recommend for the experience up to Tier 1 missions. Once you hit tier 2, you have to go multiplayer and download hundreds of player-made scripts which just beat the game for you with nothing but copy-pasting and waiting for the mission to be completed. Doesn't seem like very much fun to rely on player-made everything and very little thought process for yourself. If I saw a way to get myself from tier 2 to scripting my own automatic bank hack, I would stick around, but it's all already done. All the code is already written, the game is already completed.

{"review":"An incredibly well made hacking simulation. Basically its Uplink but with real world equivalent terminal hacking, the ability to code your own programs and the ability to host your own websites. Very addicting. Its also online and fully PvP. My only criticism is that 1. the HTML documentation is non-existent, what you can do in HTML IRL is not the same as what you can do in the game - there are limits 2. Stealing from banks is untraceable for the most part - which is a shame because it was a major source of panic in Uplink when hacking banks, here its non-existent. I'm sure the devs will add it 3. The UI doesn't quite work like Windows, example: you can't drag files onto say the Notepad or Codeeditor, and just in general dragging icons is a bit clunky.\n\nOtherwise this game is amazing, very addictive and I highly recommend it.","voted_up":1,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":1,"received_for_free":0,"author_playtime_forever":1618,"author_playtime_last_two_weeks":1618,"author_playtime_at_review":1094,"author_last_played":1705210621000,"textblob_sentiment":0.17625,"log_playtime_forever":7.3895639537,"log_playtime_at_review":6.9985096423,"log_playtime_last_two_weeks":7.3895639537,"normalized_playtime_forever":0.0154978308,"normalized_playtime_at_review":0.2988255854,"normalized_playtime_last_two_weeks":2.7039682863,"playtime_ratio":0.6761433869,"days_from_last_played_time":3,"review_length":837,"review_word_count":152,"engagement_score":0,"playtime_category":"Very High","reviewer_experience":"Veteran","vader_sentiment":-0.2591,"cleaned_review_tokens":["an","incredibly","well","made","hacking","simulation","basically","its","uplink","but","with","real","world","equivalent","terminal","hacking","the","ability","to","code","your","own","programs","and","the","ability","to","host","your","own","websites","very","addicting","its","also","online","and","fully","pvp","my","only","criticism","is","that","the","html","documentation","is","nonexistent","what","you","can","do","in","html","irl","is","not","the","same","as","what","you","can","do","in","the","game","there","are","limits","stealing","from","banks","is","untraceable","for","the","most","part","which","is","a","shame","because","it","was","a","major","source","of","panic","in","uplink","when","hacking","banks","here","its","nonexistent","im","sure","the","devs","will","add","it","the","ui","doesnt","quite","work","like","windows","example","you","cant","drag","files","onto","say","the","notepad","or","codeeditor","and","just","in","general","dragging","icons","is","a","bit","clunky","otherwise","this","game","is","amazing","very","addictive","and","i","highly","recommend","it"],"review_tokens_no_stopwords":["incredibly","well","made","hacking","simulation","basically","uplink","real","world","equivalent","terminal","hacking","ability","code","programs","ability","host","websites","addicting","also","online","fully","pvp","criticism","html","documentation","nonexistent","html","irl","limits","stealing","banks","untraceable","part","shame","major","source","panic","uplink","hacking","banks","nonexistent","im","sure","devs","add","ui","doesnt","quite","work","like","windows","example","cant","drag","files","onto","say","notepad","codeeditor","general","dragging","icons","bit","clunky","otherwise","amazing","addictive","highly","recommend"],"cleaned_reviews_NS":"incredibly well made hacking simulation basically uplink real world equivalent terminal hacking ability code programs ability host websites addicting also online fully pvp criticism html documentation nonexistent html irl limits stealing banks untraceable part shame major source panic uplink hacking banks nonexistent im sure devs add ui doesnt quite work like windows example cant drag files onto say notepad codeeditor general dragging icons bit clunky otherwise amazing addictive highly recommend","retention_score":0.4615055234,"retention_score_scaled":0.6225727287}

{"review":"I came to this game with no previous IRL programming language (I didnt even know what Linux commands were or how to use them lolol) but i saw Thor from PirateSoftware playing and talking about it and i enjoy learning so gave the game a try. (I am glad this game is a much simplified down version from what i researched though cuz from my readings there is a LOT more complexity to Unix commands that is still kinda mystifying to me at the moment lolol small progress is still progress is my go to lolol)\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have a programming\/computer background (like me) who wants to be introduced to some new concepts to research and try to apply (This IS a game and I by no means think it is a 1 to 1 comparison to IRL, but for me it has helped give me a context to even learn how to ask the questions of myself to research, mostly through google and in game documentation lolol) a little of actual computer knowledge: see below for more in-depth info on an example of mine from when I first started (I am still SO new and as I learn bits of this or that in-game system it hints at a vastness of knowledge in the distance for me that can at times feel a little overwhelming but also exciting and fulfilling when I start seeing my research paying off in helping me understand what is needed to get into the NPC computer is hella fulfilling to me. \n\nThis game hits SOOOOOOOOO many of my reward center chemical release buttons! llololol \n\nThe 1st time i got into a NPC computer? WHOOOOO in my brain\nthe 1st time i was able to take and decrypt a bank acct? WHOOOOO\n1st time i transferred all the money from a NPC to MY bank acct?? LOOT GOBLIN MODE ACTIVATED!!!! \n\nThe community and a few people in particular for me have been a super helpful and inviting source of information, and there is almost always someone who can point me in the direction or give me a subtle hint on what I might want to explore learning about to get my problem solved if my solo researching isnt working or i feel stuck, so even as a new player with no background in computers I have felt able to process and learn the in game systems at least to a semi-functional state (I built my first in-game multi-tool script this morning after like DAYS spent trying things out! it lets me grab and decipher the npc's passwords and THEN it grabs their deciphered bank and mail passwords too! let's go! it's dinky and silly but i am excited! Big thank you to the main person in VC who was giving me invaluable bug hunting tips; never would have thought of those options if they hadn't mentioned it lolol) \n\nI think this game has been a wonderful way to give me new concepts in programming and computers that I would not have even known the question to ask if I was not playing this game and getting the game missions wherefor example I go, well I am lost on what a port 3306 is; so I googled up information on what is port for computer and learned a bunch about port # standardization, etc.... then I felt a huge amount of accomplishment (kinda silly but it IS true lolol) so then I could use the knowledge that 3306 port is SQL to use the in game shops to get a proper exploit, BAM got in to the npc computer!\n\nthis is a real example; I didnt know what ports are in a computer sense, MAY or may not have had the first thought of, hmmm that's weird why is this referencing ship ports? lolol) \n\nWill be looking forward to learning even more and playing this game for a metric a** ton of hours more, I now see why there are guides in the community from players with multiple THOUSANDS of hours lolol \n\nLooking forward to learning to a point where I feel proficient enough to join multiplayer, some of the things ive read in the Official discord and PirateSoft's channel for this game are crazy fun sounding

{"review":"I have been enjoying the game, but as someone that knows little to nothing when it comes to networking, and all of this code, I find it difficult. A lot of the tutorials you can find online or bits of help people have shared are all out of date and are rarely helpful in learning the coding yourself. Some of the explanations in the manual just do not seem in-depth enough for me to get a grasp on what I am doing wrong or right when my scripts work or not. Smaller basic hacks are simple enough, but figuring out why a metaxploit works or not, or how it finds access to a guess account via http or ssh I just don't understand.

Goblin approved! (Cannot smash that like button enough!)\n\nLonger Answer: This game is the most complete hacking sim I have played so far. It does have a bit of a learning curve to it, but so does real life. You start with just a basic rig and your knowledge; no internet access, no fancy tools. I've spent plenty of hours in Single Player getting used to the games scripting\/programming abilities and building tools useful to me. Even making my own improvements to tools already available in the game! I love that you can do this in Grey Hack! This means the game can evolve with the player base but it also means you will want to stay alert! While you are developing tools to gain access to other systems, so is the rest of the community. If this is your jam then you need to get Grey Hack.\n\nSummary:\nThis game is still in development but its progess and accuracy so far is scary with a single developer.
